<h2><a name="WILSONS" id="WILSONS"></a>WILSON'S TALES OF THE BORDERS, AND OF SCOTLAND.</h2>

<h4>THE BURGHER'S TALES.</h4>
<h4>THE HOUSE IN BELL'S WYND.</h4>


<p>Some reference has been made by Mr. Chambers, in his
<i>Traditions of Edinburgh</i>, to a story which looks very like
fiction, but the foundation of which, I dare to say, is
the following, derived at most third-hand, from George
Gourlay, a blacksmith, whose shop was in the Luckenbooths,
his dwelling-house in Bell's Wynd, and who
was himself an actor in the drama.</p>

<p>It is not saying much for the topography of an
Edinburgh wynd, to tell that it contained a flat such as
that occupied by this blacksmith; but he who would
describe one of these peculiar features of the Old Town,
would be qualified to come after him who gave a graphic
account of the Dædalian Labyrinth, or pictured
Menander. Such a wynd has been likened to the
vestibule to a certain place, more hot than cozy&mdash;at
another time, to two long tiers of catacombs with living
mummies piled row over row; but, resigning such
extravagances, we may be within the bounds of moderation,
and not beyond the attributes of fair similitude,
when we say that one of these wynds is like a perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>town where the long, narrow, dark streets, in
place of extending themselves, as they ought, on the
earth's surface, proceed upwards to the sky. And
which sky is scarcely visible&mdash;not that, if the perpendicular
line were maintained, the empyrean would be so
very much obscured, but that the inhabitants, in proportion
as they rise away from mother earth and
society, make amends by jutting out their dwellings in
the form of Dutch gables, so as to be able to converse
with their neighbours opposite on the affairs of the
world below&mdash;that world above, to which they are
so much nearer, being despised, on the principle of
familiarity producing contempt. Then the sky-line
would so much delight a Gothic architect, composed as
it is of a long multiplicity on either side of pointed
gables, lum-tops venting reek and smoke, dried women's
heads venting something of the same kind. Next, the
dark boles of openings to these perpendicular passages&mdash;so
like entries to coal cellars,&mdash;yet where myriads
of human beings pass and repass up to and down
from these skyward streets, which have no name;
being the only streets in the wide world without a
nomenclature.</p>

<p>We picture the said George Gourlay and his wife, of
an evening, at the time of the history of Bell's Wynd,
and other such wynds, when a change was taking place
among the masses there. The New Town was beginning
to hold out its aristocratic attractions to the grandees
and wealthy merchants, who had chosen to live so long
in so pent-up a place. Ay, many had left years before,
or were leaving their lairs to be occupied by those who
never thought they would live in houses with armorial
bearings over the door. So it was that flats were shut
up, and little wonder was created by the circumstance
of windows being closed by inside shutters for years.
The explanation simply was, that the good old family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
would come back to its old <i>lares</i>, or that no tenant
could be got for the empty house. And then, of course,
the furniture had flitted to the palaces beyond the North
Loch; and what interest could there be in an empty
house with the bare walls overhung by cobwebs, or
gnawed into sinuosities by hungry rats, thus cruelly
deserted by the cooks who ought to have fed them?
Yet, in that same stair where Gourlay lived, there was
a <i>door</i> with a history that could not be explained in
that easy way.</p>

<p>"I say it puzzles me, guidwife Christian, and has
done for years."</p>

<p>"And mair it should me, George. You have been
here only nine years, but 'tis now twenty-one since my
father was carried to the West Kirk; and a year afore
that I heard him say the house was left o' a morning:
nor sound nor sigh o' human being has been heard in't
since that hour."</p>

<p>"And then the changes," said Geordie, "hae ta'en
awa the auld folk whase gleg een would hae noticed it.
As for Bailie or Dean o' Guild, nane o' them hae ever
tirled the padlock."</p>

<p>"But the factor, auld Dallas o' Lady Stair's Close,
dee'd shortly after my father, and that will partly account
for't."</p>

<p>"It accounts for naething, guidwife Christian," rejoined
he. "Whar's the laird? Men are sometimes
forgetfu'; but what man, or woman either, ever forgets
their property or heirlooms? Ye ken, love Christian,"
he continued, looking askance at her, half in seriousness
and half in humour, "I am a blacksmith, and hae routh
o' skeleton keys."</p>

<p>"And never ane o' them will touch that padlock
while I'm in your keeping, Geordie. I took ye for an
honest man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>An opposition or check which Gourlay did not altogether
like; for, in secret truth, he had long contemplated
an entry by these said skeleton keys, and, like
all people who want a justification for some act they wish
to perform, not altogether consistent with what is right,
he had often in serious playfulness knocked his foot
against the old worm-eaten, wood-rusted, dry-rotted
door, as if he expected some confined ghost to shriek,
like that unhappy spirit of the Buchan Caves, "Let me
out, let me out!" whereupon Mr. Gourlay would have
been, we doubt not, more humane than his old father-god,
who would not let the pretty mother of love out of
his iron net.</p>

<p>"Honest! there's twa-three kinds o' honesty, wife
Christian. There's the cauld iron or steel kind, that
will neither brak nor bend&mdash;the lukewarm, that is
stiff&mdash;and the red hot, which canna be handled, but
may be twisted by a bribe o' the hammer, or the
cajoling o' the nippers. What kind would ye wish
mine to be?"</p>

<p>"The cauld, that winna bend."</p>

<p>"And canna be fashioned to man's purposes, and
made a picklock o'? Weel, weel, Christian, I'm content."</p>

<p>But George Gourlay was not content, neither then
nor for several nights; nor even in that hour when,
having watched guidwife Christian as she lay on the
liver side, and heard the "snurr, snurr," of her deepest
sleep, and listened to the corresponding knurr of the
old timepiece as it beat hoarsely the key-stone hour
between the night and the day, he slipt noiselessly out
of bed, and listened again to ascertain whether his
stealthy movement had disturbed his wife. All safe&mdash;nor
sound anywhere within the house, or even in the
Wynd, where midnight orgies of the new-comers some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>times
annoyed the remaining grandees not yet gone
over the Loch; no, nor rap, rap, upwards from the
spirits in the deserted house right below him, inviting
him by the call of "Let me out." Most opportune
silence,&mdash;not even broken by guidwife Christian's
Baudron watching with brain-lighted eyes at some hole
in a meat-press. And dark too, not less than Cimmerian,
save only for a small rule of moonlight, which,
penetrating a circular hole in the shutter, played fitfully,
as the clouds went over its source, on a point of
the red curtains&mdash;sometimes disappearing altogether.
By a little groping he got his hose; nor more would
he venture to search for, but finding his way by touch
of the finger, he reached the kitchen, where he lighted
the end of a small dip. A sorry glimmer indeed; but
it enabled him to lay his hands on a bunch of crooked
instruments, which he lifted so stealthily that even a
mouse would have continued nibbling forbidden cheese,
and been not a whit alarmed. Then there was the
more dangerous opening of the door leading to the
tortuous stair&mdash;dangerous, for that quick ear ben the
house, which knew the creak as well as she did the
accents of Geordie Gourlay. Ah, <i>tutum silentii præmium</i>!
has he not gone through all this, and reached
the stair without a sneeze or sigh of mortal to disturb
him!</p>

<p>So far was he fortunate; and slipshod in worsted
of wife Christian's own working, who so little thought,
as she pleased herself with the reflection of the softness
for his feet, that she was to be cheated thereby,
he slipped gently down the steps on this enterprise he
had revolved in his mind for years and years of bygone
time. Come to the identical old door. He had examined
it often by candle-light before; and as for the
rusty hasp and staple, and appended padlock, he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
them well, with all their difficulties to even smith's
hands of his horny manipulation. He laid down the
glimmering candle and paused. What a formidable
object of occlusion, that door by which no one had
entered for twenty years! Geordie knew nothing of
the old notion, that time fills secret and vacant recesses
with terrified ghosts, frightened away from the haunts
of men; yet he had strange misgivings, which, being
the instinctive suggestions of a rude mind, had a better
chance for being true to nature. Perhaps the cold
night air, to which his shirt offered small impediment,
helped his tremulousness; and that was not diminished
when, on seizing the padlock, a scream from some
drunken unfortunate in the Wynd struck on his ear
and died away in the midnight silence. Nor was he
free from the pangs of conscience, as he thought of the
injunctions of guidwife Christian, and, more than these,
the sanctions of morality and the laws; but then he
was not a thief,&mdash;only an antiquary, searching into a
dungeon of time-hallowed curiosities and relics. He
laid his hard hand on the rusty padlock. He was
accustomed to the screech of old bolts, but that now
was as if it came from some of Vulcan's chains whereby
he caught the old thieves. The key-hole was entirely
filled up with red rust, which, like silence stuffing up
the mouth, had kept the brain-works unimpaired; so
it needed no long time till, through his cunning
crooks, he heard the nick of the receding bolt. A
tug brought up the hasp, and now all ought to
have been clear; but it was otherwise. Time, with
his warpings and accumulating glues, had been there
too long&mdash;the door would not give way, even to a
smith's right hand; but Geordie had a potency in his
back, before which other unwilling impediments of the
same kind, sometimes with a debtor's resistance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
other side, had given way. That potency he applied;
and the groan of the hinges responding fearfully to his
ears, the vision was at length realized, of that door
standing open for the passage of human beings.</p>

<p>So far committed, Geordie's courage came with a
drawing up of his muscles; and muttering between
his teeth, which risped like files, "I will face any one
except the devil," he lifted the candle, the glimmer of
which paled in the thick air of the opening. He waved
it up and down before he entered; but it seemed as if
the weak rays could not find their way in the dense
atmosphere&mdash;enough, notwithstanding, to show him
dimly a long lobby. He snorted as the accumulated
must stimulated his nostrils; but there was more than
must&mdash;the smell was that of an opened grave which
had been covered with moil for a century. Yet his
step was instinctively forward,&mdash;the small light flitting
here and there like the fitful gleam of a magic lantern.
Half groping with the left hand, as he held the candle
with his right, he soon began to discover particulars.
There were three doors, opening no doubt to rooms, on
his left; and as the light&mdash;becoming accustomed, like
men's eyes, to the dark&mdash;shone forwards towards the
end, he saw another door, which was open. Desperate
men&mdash;and Geordie was now wound up&mdash;aim at the
farthest extremities. He made his way forward, laying
down each stocking-clad foot as if in fear of being heard
by the family below, whose hysterics at a tread above
them at midnight, and in that house, would lead to
inquiry and detection.</p>

<p>He came at length to the open door at the end of
the lobby, and ventured in. He was presently in the
middle of the kitchen, holding the candle up to see as
far around him as he could. Geordie had never read
of those scenes of enchantment where veritable men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and women, with warm blood in their veins, were, on
being touched by a wand, changed into statues with
the very smile on their faces which they wore at the
moment of transmutation; in which state they were to
remain for a hundred years, till the wand was broken
by a fairy, when they would all start into their old life.
No matter if he had not, for here there was no change:
the kitchen was as it had been left, twenty years before.
The plate-rack, with the china set all along in regular
order&mdash;no change there; nor on the row of pewter
jugs, one of which stood on the dresser, with a bottle
alongside, and a screw with the cork still on its spiral
end. No doubt some one had been drinking just on
the eve of the cessation of the living economy. A
square fir-table stood in the middle, supplied with
plates ready to be carried to the dining-room; and
these plates were certainly not to have been supplied
with imaginary meals, like those in the Eastern tale,
for, as he held the candle down towards the grate, yet
half filled with cinders, he saw the horizontal spit with
the skeleton of a goose stuck on it. The motion of the
spit had been suspended when the works ran out, and
Baudron had feasted upon the flesh when it became
cold. Nay, that cat, no doubt cherished, lay extended
in anatomy before the fireplace. Nor could it be
doubted that the roast had not been ready; for the
axe lay beside a piece of coal half splintered, for the
necessities of the diminished fire. An industrious house
too, wherein the birr of the wheel and the sneck of the
reel had sounded: the pirn was half filled, and the
wisp, from which the thread had been drawn, lay over
the back of a chair, as it had been taken from the
waist of the servant maid. But why should not the
sluttish girl's bed have been made at a time of the day
when a goose was roasting for dinner? Nor did Geordie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
try to answer, because the question was as far from his
wondering mind, as the time when he stood there himself
enchanted was from the period of that marvellous
dereliction.</p>

<p>With eyes rounder, and wider, and considerably
glegger, than when he left goodwife Christian snoring
in her bed, so unconscious of what her husband was to
see, he retraced his steps to the kitchen-door, and turning
to the right, opened that next to him. It was the
dining-room. He peered about as his wonder still
grew. The long oak-table, in place of the modern
sideboard, ran along the farther end, whereon were
decanters and two silver cups; and not far from these
a salver, with a shrivelled lump, hard as whinstone, and
of the form of a loaf, with a knife lying alongside.
The very cushion of the settee opposite to the fireplace
had preserved upon it the indentation of a human head.
But much less wonderful was the cloth-covered table,
with salt-cellars and spice-boxes, and plates, with knives
and forks appropriated to each; for had not Geordie
seen the goose at the fire in the kitchen! The indispensable
pictures, too, were all round on the dingy
walls&mdash;every one a portrait&mdash;staring through dust; and
a special one of a female, with voluminous silks, and a
high flour-starched toupee, claimed the charmed eye of
the blacksmith. Even in the vertigo of his wonder, he
looked stedfastly at that beautiful face; nor did the
painted eye look less stedfastly at him, as if, after
twenty years, it was again charmed by the vision of a
living man, to the withdrawing of that eye from the
figure alongside of her, so clearly that of her husband.
That they were master and mistress of this very house
he would have concluded, if he had been calm enough
to think; but he was, alas, still under the soufflé of the
bellows of romantic wonder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Where next, if he could take his eye off that beautiful
countenance? There was a middle door leading into
another room: he would persevere and still explore.
Holding up the fast-diminishing candle, he looked in.
There was a female figure there, standing in the dark,
beside a bed. It was arrayed in a long gown, reaching
to the feet, of pure white (as accords). It moved.
Geordie could see it plainly: it was the only thing with
living motion in all that still and dreary habitation.
Hitherto his hair had kept wonderfully flat and sleek,
but now it began to crisp, and swirm, and rise on end;
while his legs shook, and the trembling had made the
glimmer oscillate in every direction, whereby sometimes
it turned away from the figure, again to illuminate it
sparingly, and again to vibrate off. He could not, notwithstanding
his terror, recede; nay, he tried ineffectually
to fix the ray on the very thing that thrilled him
through every nerve. Verily, he would even go forward,
under the charm of his fear, which, like other morbid
feelings, would feed on the object which produced it.
First a step, and then a step. The glimmer was again
off the mark; and when he got to the bed, the figure
was gone&mdash;according to the old law.</p>

<p>But the bed was too certainly there, with its deep
green curtains, which were drawn close, indicating
midnight; and yet the goose at the fire, and the table
laid! Nor could Geordie explain the physical anomaly,
probably for the reason that he did not try. His candle
was wasting away with those endless oscillations: the
figure in white itself had run off with the half of the
short stump; and he feared again to be left in the dark,
where he would have a difficulty in finding his way out.
Yet he felt he must draw these deep green curtains:
the broad hand of Fate was upon his shoulders. He
seized them hysterically, and pulled them aside far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
enough to let in his head and the candle hand. A
dark counterpane was covered quarter-inch thick with
dust; but the odour was not now of must, it was a
choking flesh and bone rot, scarcely bearable; even
the light felt the heaviness, and almost died away in
his tremulous fingers. There were clothes beneath the
counterpane, and a long, narrow tumulus down the
middle, as if a body were there, of half its usual size;
but little more was visible, till the eye was turned to
the top where the pillow lay, half up which the dark
counterpane was drawn. There was a head on the
pillow, partly covered by the coverlet, partly by a
round-eared mutch&mdash;once, no doubt, white as snow,
now brown as a Norway rat's back; yet Geordie would
peer, and peer, till he saw an orbless socket of pure
white bone, and a portion of two rows of white teeth
clenched. An undoing of the clothes would have
shown him&mdash;how much more? But his shaking was
now a palsy of the brain, and he could not undo the
suspected horror. He turned suddenly; and, as the
green curtain fell with a flap, the dip lost its flame, and
a black reek vied with that heavy cadaverousness. He
was in the dark.</p>

<p>Such is the effect of degrees, that, as he groped and
groped in a place where he had lost all landmarks, and
the topography had become a confusion, he could have
wished to see again the figure in white; which, from its
own light, could surely, as a spirit, lead him out. His
brain got into a swirl. If the white figure was the
spirit of that thing which he had seen so partially in
the bed, would it not return to flit about its own old
tenement? yet not a trail of that white light cast a
glance anywhere. Groping and groping, knocking his
head against unknown things, he turned and turned,
but could not find the lobby. He had got through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
another door, but not that leading outwards. He must
have got into another room; for he felt and grasped
things he had not heretofore seen. Then the noise he
had made had such a dreary sound, falling on his
strained, nerve-strung ear! His hand shrunk at everything
he touched, as if it had been a deaf adder, or
deadly nag&mdash;above all, a shock of hair, from which he
recoiled more than ever yet, till the devious turns
round and round obliterated every recollection of what
he had understood of localities. So far he must have
retraced his steps; for he had again the green curtain
in his left hand without knowing it, and the right went
slap upon that round-eared mutch, and the bone that
was under the same. Recalled a little to his senses, he
got at length to the kitchen, circumambulated and circummanipulated
the table, and groped his way to the
door in the end of the lobby, through which he had
first entered. All safe now by the lines of the two
walls, he hugged the outer door as if it had been a
twenty years' absent friend, a father, or a wife.</p>

<p>Nor did he take time to relock the padlock. He had,
besides, lost his crooked instruments. Ah! how sweet
to get into a warm bed safe and sound, after having
fancied that from such a white figure hovering round
dry bones he had heard&mdash;for Geordie had read plays&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I am that body's spirit,</span><br />
Doomed for a certain time to walk the night;<br />
And for the day confined, to fast in fires,<br />
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br />
Are burnt and purged away."<br />
</p>

<p>How delightful to Geordie was that snore of wife
Christian, as she still lay on the liver side, perhaps
dreaming of seraphim!</p>

<p>The adventure of that midnight hour dated the be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ginning
of a change on George Gourlay. One might
have said of him, with the older playwright who never
pictured a ghost, <i>quod scis nescis</i>; for then never a word
scarcely would he speak to man or beast, nay, not even
to a woman, who has a power of breaking the charm of
that silence in others of which their sex are themselves
incapable&mdash;even, we say, wife Christian. There are
many Trophonian caves in the world about us, only
known to ourselves, out of which, when we come, we are
mute, because we have seen something different from
the objects of the sunlight; yea, if, as the Indians say,
the animals are the dumb of earth, these are the dumb
of heaven. Certain at least it is, that while Geordie
did not hesitate before that night to use his voice in
asking an extravagant price for an old lock, or even
damning him who below made more noise than nails,
he never now used that tongue in such dishonesties and
irreverences. But, what was even more strange, wife
Christian did not seem to have any inclination to break
his silent mood; nay, if he was moody, so was she.
Then her eyelight was so changed to him, that he could
not thereby, as formerly, read her thoughts. Perhaps
she took all this on from imitation; but she was not
one of the imitative children of genius&mdash;rather a hard-grained
Cameronian, to whom others' thoughts are only
as a snare; yet, might she not have had suspicions of
her husband's silence? All facts were against such a
supposition, except one: that, on the following morning,
she observed dryly, that the dip she had left in the
kitchen had burnt away of its own special accord.
Vain thoughts all. Geordie was simply "born again;"
and old women do not speak to infants, until, at least,
they can hear.</p>

<p>Nor did this mood promise amendment even up to
that night, when a rap having come to the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Geordie started, while guidwife Christian went undismayed
to open the same; for, moody as she was, she
was not affected by evening raps as he was, and had
been since that eventful midnight. But if the sturdy
blacksmith was afraid before she obeyed the call, he
was greatly more so after she had opened the door,
and when she led into the parlour an old man, with
hair more than usually grey even for his years, with a
staff in his hand, bearing up, as he came in, a tall,
wasted body&mdash;so wasted, that he might have been supposed
to have waited all this time for a leg of that
goose which had been so very long at the fire. The
grief of years had eaten up his face, and only left untouched
the corrugations itself had made. Yet withal
he was a gentleman; for his bow to Geordie was just
that which the grandees of the Wynd made to each
other as they passed and repassed. No sooner was he
seated, holding his cane between his shrivelled legs,
and his sharp grey eye fixed on the blacksmith, than
the latter became as one enchanted for a second time,
with all the horrors of the first catalepsy upon him, by
the process of the double sense insisted for by Abercromby,
but thus known in Bell's Wynd before his day.
Yes, Geordie was entranced again, nor less guidwife
Christian&mdash;both staring at the stranger, as if their
minds had gone back through long bygone years to
catch the features of a prototype for comparison with
that long, withered face, so yellow and grave-like; then
Christian looked stealthily, and concealed her face.</p>

<p>"You are a blacksmith, Mr. Gourlay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here in Bell's Wynd?"</p>

<p>"Nine years, come Beltane Feast."</p>

<p>"Not so much as the half of twenty," said the stranger,
more inwards than outwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty!" ejaculated Christian, as if she could not
just help herself.</p>

<p>And Geordie searched her rigid face for a stray
sympathy, repeating within the teeth that very same
word&mdash;"Twenty."</p>

<p>"Then," continued the old man, "you cannot tell
who occupied the flat below at that long period back?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And who occupies it now?"</p>

<p>Geordie was as dumb as the white figure, or as the
head on the pillow with the rat-brown mutch; and
this time Christian answered for him:</p>

<p>"It hasna been occupied for twenty years, sir; and
it has been shut up a' that lang time."</p>

<p>"Twenty years!" ejaculated the old man, pondering
deeply, and sighing heavily and painfully.</p>

<p>"Do any of you know Mr. Thomas Dallas, the Clerk
to the Signet, who lived once in Lady Stair's Close?"</p>

<p>"Dead eighteen years since," replied the wife.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," rejoined the stranger; "and so the house
has been thus long closed!" Then musingly, "But then
it will be empty&mdash;no furniture, nothing but bare walls."</p>

<p>"Naebody kens," replied George, still busy examining
the face of the questioner, as if he could not get it to
be steady alongside the image in his own mind.</p>

<p>"You can, of course, open a padlock?"</p>

<p>"Ou ay, when it's no owre auld, and the brass slide
has been well kept on the key-hole." Then, as if recollecting
himself, "I hinna tried an auld ane for years."</p>

<p>"One twenty years unopened?" rejoined the stranger.</p>

<p>Geordie was again dumb and rigid.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," replied Christian, who saw that her
husband was under some strong feeling, "he can pick
ony lock."</p>

<p>"The very man," said the mysterious visitor. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
now, madam, will you allow me to take the liberty of
requesting to be for a few moments the only one
present in this room with your husband, as I have
some business of a very secret nature to transact with
him, which it would not be proper for a woman,
even of your evident discretion and confidence, to be
acquainted with?"</p>

<p>"I dinna want ye to gang," whispered George.</p>

<p>"And what for no?" muttered she. "Let evil-doers
dree the shame o' their deeds. Didna ye say to me ye
were an honest man, ay, even as cauld iron or steel,
and what ought ye to hae to fear? And now, sir,"
turning round, "I will e'en tak me to the kitchen, that
what ye want wi' George Gourlay you may do in secret,
even as he has been secret wi' me."</p>

<p>Then guidwife Christian went out, casting, as she
went, a look of something like triumph at her husband.</p>

<p>"And now, George Gourlay," said the stranger, "the
secret thing I have to transact with you, and for which
I have come three thousand miles, is to ask you to go
with me this night and open the padlock of the door of
that house below, which has not been opened for twenty
years."</p>

<p>"I winna, I canna, I daurna, sir. Gang to the Dean
o' Guild. There's a dead body in the green bed, and
there's a spirit in a lang white goun that watches it."</p>

<p>The hand of the stranger shook, as he grasped
spasmodically his staff; his teeth for a moment were
clenched; and he plainly showed a resolution not to
seem moved by that which as clearly did move him to
the innermost parts of his being. Nor did it now escape
Gourlay, as he sat and gazed at him, that he was the
original of that picture in the dining-room, which hung
by the side of the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>"Then you must have been in?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Geordie was silent, meditating on some new light
gradually breaking in upon him.</p>

<p>"You must have been in, and&mdash;and&mdash;know the
secret?"</p>

<p>"I ken nae secret, except it be that the goose which
has been at the fire for twenty years is no roasted yet."</p>

<p>"That goose at the fire even yet!" ejaculated the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Ay, and the thread still on the pirn."</p>

<p>"Pirn!" responded he mechanically.</p>

<p>"Ay, and the bottle standing on the dresser along by
the pewter mug."</p>

<p>"Mug!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and the half-cut loaf on the oaken table, with
alongside o't the knife."</p>

<p>"Knife!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and to cap a', the green bed with the dark red
counterpane, and in it still the corpse."</p>

<p>"Corpse!"</p>

<p>"So, so," continued the stranger, "I have been wandering
the wide world for twenty years to escape from
myself, as if a man could leave his shadow in the east
when he has gone to the west, and all that time found
the vanity of a forced forgetfulness where the touch of
God's finger still burned in the heart. Ay, nor long
prairies, nor savannahs where objects are cast behind
and not seen, nor thick woods which exclude the sun,
nor rocky caves by the sea-shore, where there is only
heard the roaring of the waves, could untwine the dark
soul from its recollections. But other things of earth
and human workmanship rot and pass away, as if all
were vanity, but man's spirit; and yet here it has been
decreed by Heaven, and wrought by miracle, that things
of flesh, and bone, and wood, and dried grass should be
enchanted for duration, yea, kept in the very place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
form, and lineaments they possessed in a terrible hour,
the memory of which they must conserve for a purpose.
Speak man: Have those sights and things taught you
aught of a purpose? Why look ye at me as if you
saw into my heart, and grin as if you were gifted with
the right of revenge? What thoughts have you&mdash;what
wishes? What do you premeditate?"</p>

<p>"Just nae mair than that you'll no get me to enter
that house again."</p>

<p>The stranger's head was bent down in heavy sorrow;
and, after being silent for a while, he rose, and bidding
Gourlay good night, went away, saying he would get
another locksmith. The strange manner of Christian
was now made even more remarkable, as, taking her
bonnet and cloak, she sallied forth, late as the hour
was, proceeding up the Wynd, and muttering as she
went, "The very man, the very man," she made direct
for Blackfriars Wynd, where she stopt, and looked up
to a small window on the right hand. There was light
in it; and ascending a narrow stair she reached a door,
which she quietly opened. A woman was there, busily
spinning. The birr ceased as the door opened.</p>

<p>"Ann Hall," cried Christian, as she entered, "he is
come, he is come! I kent his face the moment I saw it."</p>

<p>"Patience, patience, Christian," replied the woman,
"what are you to do?"</p>

<p>"There maun be nae patience, when God says haste."</p>

<p>"Canny, canny. The wa's are thin and ears are gleg.
I can hear a whisper frae the next room. Now, I'll
spin and you'll speak."</p>

<p>And so she began to produce the dirl by turning the
wheel and plying the thread.</p>

<p>"What although ye hae seen him? that maks nae
difference. Your aith is still afore the Lord; and
though we are forbidden to swear, when we hae sworn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
we hae nae right to brak that aith, as if it were a silly
wand, to be broken and cast awa' at the end o' our
journey. And then ye maun keep in mind, if you brak
your word, ye stretch his neck."</p>

<p>"I carena," replied Christian. "The Lord maun hae
His ain for reward, and Satan maun hae his ain, too,
for punishment. Sin' ever that eery night when in my
night-shirt I followed George into the house, and saw
what I saw, the Spirit o' the Lord has been busy in my
heart; and my aith has been to me nae mair than a
windlestrae in the east wind, to be blawn awa' where it
listeth. Ye are, like mysel', o' the Auld Light, and ken
what it is to hae the finger o' command laid upon ye."</p>

<p>"We maun obey; but we maun ken whether the
finger is for the will o' the auld rebel o' pride, wha
rebelled in heaven, or Him wha says to the murderer,
Get ye among the rocks or caves o' secrecy, and I will
search ye out, and rug ye into the licht."</p>

<p>"And what for should I no ken whase finger it is?"
said wife Christian. "Have I no seen what I have seen?
For what are a' thae things keepit, as man keeps the
apple o' his e'e? Is na the rust and the worm, ay, and
Time's teeth, aye eating, and gnawing, and tearing, so
that everything passes awa' to make room for others,
as if the hail warld were a whirligig turning round
like your ain wheel there for ever and ever?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the Lord's hand, na doubt. The deil doesna
keep the instruments and signs o' his evil, but shuffles
them awa' in nooks and corners to be out o' the een o'
his victims."</p>

<p>"But hae I no laid my very hand on the fleshless head
o' the bonny misguided creature? Wae tak the man
wha brought sae muckle beauty to the earth to rot,
and yet hae nae grave to cover it!"</p>

<p>"Weel mind I o' her," said Ann, as she still made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
wheel go round. "How she sailed up the Wynd wi'
her load o' silks and satins, and the ribbons that waved
in the wind, as if to say, Look here; saw ye ever the
like among the daughters o' men?"</p>

<p>"It was left to testify, woman, naething else; but
the glimmer o' Geordie's candle showed me a' the lave.
Ay, the very goose I plucked, and drew, and singed,
and put on the spit&mdash;what for is it there, think ye,
cummer, but to testify? and the pewter jug I drank
out o' that forenoon, and my ain bed I hadna time to
mak&mdash;what for but to testify?"</p>

<p>"And punish. But oh, woman, he had sair provocations.
Wha was that goose for?"</p>

<p>"For her lover, nae doubt; for my master wasna
expected hame for a week. And was I no guilty
mysel', wha played into her hands, and was fause to
him wha fed me?"</p>

<p>"Haud your peace, then, and say naething. The
Lord will forgi'e you."</p>

<p>"Oh God, hae mercy on me, a sinner; and tak awa'
frae me this transgression, that I may lift up my voice
in the tabernacle without fear or trembling!"</p>

<p>The wheel turned with greater celerity and more
noise, and wife Christian was on her knees, beating her
bosom and crying for mercy.</p>

<p>"Say nae mair, woman," cried the spinner, "and do
nae mair. Let the corpse lie in the green bed, and a'
thing be in the wud-dream o' that dreary house; do
nae mair."</p>

<p>"But the Lord drives me."</p>

<p>"Just sae; and he wham you would hang on the
wuddy will stand up against ye, and swear ye were the
cause o' the death o' his braw leddie, for that ye concealed
her trothlessness, and winked at her wickedness."</p>

<p>"Haud your tongue, cummer," cried the Old Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Sinner; "haud your tongue, or you'll drive me mad.
Is my heart no like aneugh to brak its strings, but ye
maun tug at them? Is my brain no het aneugh, but
ye maun set lowe to it, and burn it? And my conscience,
ken ye na what it is to hae that terrible thing
within ye, when it's waukened up like a fiend o' hell,
chasing ye wi' a red-het brand, and nae escape, for the
angel o' the Lord hauds ye agen? Ann Hall, my
auldest friend, will ye do this thing for me?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Gang to Mr B&mdash;&mdash;, the fiscal, and tell him that the
corpse is there, and that the man is here, and say naething
o' me; do this, or I'll never haud up my hands
again for grace and mercy."</p>

<p>Ann was silent, only driving the wheel, the sound of
which in the silent house&mdash;dark enough, too, in the
small light of the oil cruise over the fireplace&mdash;was all
that was heard, save the occasional sobs of the unhappy
victim of conscience.</p>

<p>"I canna, Christian; I canna, lass. I'll hang nae
man for the death o' a light-o'-love limmer, and to
save the conscience o' ane wha, if she didna see something
wrang when it <i>was</i> wrang, ought to hae seen it."</p>

<p>"I repent and am sair in the spirit," replied Christian;
"but if I had tauld him what I suspected was
wrang between Spynie&mdash;and ye ken he was a lord,
and titles cast glamour ower the een o' maidens&mdash;and
my mistress, it would hae been a' the same. But wae's
me!" she added, as she sighed from the depths of the
heart, and wrung her hands, "I had a lichtness about
me myself. A woman's no in her ain keeping at wild
happy nineteen. The heart is aye jumping against the
head. But oh, how changed when the Auld Licht shone
ower me! And hae I no been a guid wife to Geordie
Gourlay? Will you no help me, woman?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hae said it," replied Mrs Hall, as the energy of her
resolution passed into the moving power of the wheel,
and the revolutions became quicker and quicker.</p>

<p>The Cameronian stood for a moment looking at her&mdash;the
lips compressed, the brow knit, the hand firmly
bound up, and striking it upon the wall.</p>

<p>"Ye're o' my faith," said she bitterly; "and may the
Evil One help ye when ye're in need o' the Lord!"</p>

<p>And with these words she left her old friend, drawing
the door after her with a clang, which shook the crazy
tenement. In a moment she was in the street, now
beginning to be deserted. The wooden-pillared lamps,
so thinly distributed, and their small dreary spunk of
life, showed only the darkness they were perhaps intended
to illumine; and here and there was seen a
gay-dressed sprig of aristocracy, with his gold-headed
cane, cocked hat, and braided vest, strolling unsteadily
home, after having drunk his couple of claret. Solitary
city guardsmen were lounging about, as if waiting
for the peace being broken, when an encounter occurred
between some such ornamented braggadocio and a
low Wynd blackguard&mdash;ready to use his quarter-staff
against the silver-handled sword of the aristocrat;
and here and there the high-pattened, short-gowned
light-o'-love, regardless of the loud-screamed "gardy-loo,"
frolicked with "gold lace and wine," or swore the
Edinburgh oaths at untrue and discarded lovers of
their own degree. But guidwife Christian saw none
of all these things; only one engrossing vision was in
her mind, that of the sleeping scene of enchantment in
the old flat, associated with the figure of the stranger;&mdash;one
feeling only was paramount in her heart, the inspired
awe of the conviction that these petrified relics
of another time, so long back, were there waiting for
her to touch them, that they should be disenchanted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and speak and tell their tale, and then rot and depart,
according to the usual law of change, and corruption,
and decay.</p>

<p>In this mood she got to the top of the Wynd, and
was hurrying along the first or covered portion, overspread
by the front lands, and therefore dark, when
she encountered a man rolled up in a cloak. Even in
the dim light coming from the street lamp on the main
pavement, she recognised him in a moment. He was
slouching down by the side of the wall, and did not
seem to notice her. So Christian held back, until he
had got farther on. She felt herself concentrated upon
his movements, and observed that he hung about her
own stair, standing in the middle of the close, with his
eye fixed on the dark windows of the deserted flat.
There was no meaning in his action. It seemed simply
that his eye was bound to that house. So far Christian
understood the ways of the world; but there are
deeper mysteries there than she wotted of or dreamed
just then. A man will examine a gangrene if it is
hopeful; and will hope, and shrink, and be alarmed,
when the hope fails only but a little; nay, he will
dread the undoing of the bandages, lest the hope of
the prior undoing should be changed by the new aspect
into a conviction of aggravation; but there is a state of
that ailment, as of moral ills, where all hope having
vanished, despair comes to be reconciled to its own
terrors, and the eye will peer into the hopeless thing,
ay, and be charmed with it, and dally with it, as an
irremediable condition, which is his own peculium, a
part of his nature, so far changed. He then becomes
a lover of pity, as before he was a seeker for hope;
and, like a desperate bankrupt, will hawk the balance-sheet
of his ills, to make up for the subtraction from
his credit by the sympathy of the world.  So did that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
man look upon that house, a hopeless sore, after twenty
years pain and agony, with these green spots, and the
caustic-defying "proud flesh." Was not the fleshless
corpse of his dead wife still there? She was a skeleton;
but he could only fancy her as he had seen her twenty
years before, a young and beautiful woman. Nor was
he alarmed as Christian, weary of waiting but not unsteeled
now for a recognition, stept forward and confronted
him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gourlay!" he said, as he peered into her hard
face.</p>

<p>"Ay, guidwife Christian, as my husband says.
Christian Gourlay that is&mdash;Christian Dempster that
was."</p>

<p>"Dempster!" ejaculated he, as he staggered and sustained
himself against the side of the close.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;Patrick Guthrie that was when I was
Dempster, and is&mdash;ay, and will be till you are born
again, and baptized with fire."</p>

<p>"Patrick Guthrie!" he repeated. "Yes, the man,
the very man. And here, too, is the evidence kept
and preserved, perhaps more than once snatched from
death, to be here at this hour to see me, and lay your
hand on me, and be certain that I am the man, the
very man. And," after a pause, "you have kept your
sworn promise?"</p>

<p>"Till this day. Look up there, and see thae closed
shutters; go in, and behold, and say whether or not."</p>

<p>"Too faithful!" groaned he.</p>

<p>"To an aith wrung out o' me by a money-bribe and
terror."</p>

<p>"And to be repaid by a money-reward and penitence."</p>

<p>"The ane, sir, but never the other. Another day&mdash;another
day," she repeated, "will try a'."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"What mean you, Christian?"</p>

<p>"Mean I? Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"Because I am weary wandering over the face of the
earth, an exile and a criminal, for twenty long&mdash;oh long
years!"</p>

<p>"And now want rest and peace! And how can ye
get them but through the fire of the law, and the
waters of the gospel? Where are you living?"</p>

<p>"Why should I conceal from you, Christian?" said
he, thoughtfully. "No&mdash;at the White Horse in the
Canongate, under the name of Douglas."</p>

<p>"<i>Her</i> name! Then look ye to it; for there will be
human voices where none have been for twenty years,
and cries o' wonder, and tears o' pity. Yes, yes, the
long sleep is ended, for the charm is broken. Good
night."</p>

<p>And hurrying away, she mounted the stair, leaving
the man even more amazed than he was heart-broken
and miserable. Nor will we be far wrong in supposing
that Patrick Guthrie sought the White Horse probably
not to sleep, but if to sleep, as probably to dream. As
for guidwife Christian, she was soon on that side so
propitious to her snoring; and as for her dreams, they
were not more of seraphim, nor of Urim and Thummim,
than they were on that night when she was the disembodied
spirit of her who had lain so long in the bed with
green curtains. Yet, no doubt, Geordie was just as
certain that she slept as he was on that same night
when he saw the said disembodied spirit; and as for
himself, there could be little doubt that, sleeping or
waking, his mind was occupied in tracing the marked
resemblance of the stranger to the picture on the wall,
which would lead him again to the beautiful lady, and
which, again, would remind him of the bones below the
red coverlet; and then there is as little doubt as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
is about all these wonderful things, that he would fancy
himself beridden with a terrible nightmare. Oppressed
and tortured by thoughts which he could not bring to
bear on any probable event, he turned and turned; but
all his restlessness would produce no effect on guidwife
Christian, who seemed as dead asleep as ever was he of
the Cretan cave in the middle of the seventy years. Nor
could he understand this: heretofore a slight cough,
even slighter than that which brought the Doctor in
the "Devil on Two Sticks," used to awaken the faithful
wife; and now nothing would awaken her. He dodged,
he cried; but she wouldn't help to take off the nightmare,
which, with its old characteristic of tailor-folded
legs and grinning aspect, sat upon his chest, as it
heaved, but could not throw off the imp. But what
was more extraordinary, this strange conduct of Christian
was the continuation of&mdash;nay, a climax to&mdash;her
inexplicable conduct since ever that night when he
caught up in his mind, as in a prism, that midnight
vision which he had seen, and the fiery coruscations of
which still careered through his brain. Honest Geordie
had no guile; and if he had had any, the new birth he
had undergone, with the consequent baptism, would
have taken it clean away, so that there was no chance
of a suspicion of the part which guidwife Christian had
played on the said occasion. Yet, wonder as he might,
if he had known all, he would have wondered more
how any woman, even with the advantage of a "New
Light," could have snored under the purpose she had
revolved in her mind, and which she had so darkly
revealed to her old master. Ah yes, that female member,
of which so much has been said&mdash;even that it
contains on the subtle point thereof a little nerve
which anatomists cannot find in the corresponding
organ in man&mdash;can swim lightly <i>tanquam suber</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
yet never give an indication of the depths below. But
Geordie became wild;&mdash;was she dead outright? Dead
people do not snore, but the dying do in apoplexy. He
took her by the shoulders, and shook her.</p>

<p>"Christian, woman, will ye no speak, when I can get
nae rest? Wha was that man wha called here yestreen?"</p>

<p>No, she wouldn't.</p>

<p>"And did I no see you look at him as ye never looked
at man before?"</p>

<p>No avail.</p>

<p>"And what took ye out so soon after he was awa'?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"And what's mair"&mdash;the murder was now out,&mdash;"did
ye no meet him secretly at the stair-foot, and stand
and speak to him in strange words and strange signs?"</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>"And what, in the name o' Heaven, and a' the ither
powers up and down and round and round, was the
aith that ye swore to him?"</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>"And what money-bribe was it ye spak o' sae secretly
and darkly?"</p>

<p>All in vain. At length the knurr of the clock, and the
most solemn of all the hours, "one," sounded hoarsely.
Wearied, exhausted, and sorely troubled, Geordie fell
asleep, greatly aided thereto by the eternal oscillation
of that little tongue at the back of the greater and mute
one, the sound of which ceased when the blacksmith
was fairly and certainly over, just as if its services had
been no longer needed that night.</p>

<p>Surely the next of these eventful days was destined,
either by the Furies or the good goddess, to be that
day that "would try a'." Even these words Geordie
had heard, if he had not caught up many other broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sentences, which showed to his distracted mind that
guidwife Christian was in some mysterious way mixed
up with the events and things of the charmed house.
The comparatively sleepless night induced a later than
usual rising; but with what wonder did Geordie Gourlay
ascertain, that late as Christian had been out on the
previous night, she was already again forth of the house,
leaving him to the bachelor work of making his own
breakfast! Where she had gone he could not even
venture to suppose; but certain he was that her absence
was in some way connected with that stranger
with whom he had seen her in communication the
night before. The business did not admit of his waiting;
so he took his morning meal of porridge and milk,
and with thoughts anxious and deep, yet deeper in mere
feeling than portrayment of outward coming events, he
sallied forth for the Luckenbooths. On descending the
stair, he found to his dire amazement the door of the
portentous flat&mdash;that grave above ground of so many
things that should have been either under the earth, in
the sinless regions of mortality, or in the mendicant bag
of Time, rolled away beyond the ken of mortal&mdash;open.
Yes, that door, with the rusty padlock, and the creaking
hinge, and the worm-eaten panels, was open. He shuddered:
yet he looked ben into the old dark lobby, where
he had groped and so nearly lost himself; and what did
he see? His wife, guidwife Christian, standing in the
middle thereof in her white short-gown, so like, to his
imperfect vision, that spirit he had encountered in that
house before! There seemed to be others there also;
for he heard inside doors creaking, and by and by saw
come out of the far-end door that very man&mdash;yea, the
very man. The reflection of a light shone out upon him.
To escape observation, he slipt to a side; and when he
peered in again, no one was to be seen. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
passed together into some of the rooms, probably that
bedroom where stood the bed with the green curtains.
Resolved as he had been never to enter that door-way
again, he would have rushed forward, had not a hand
been laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"George Gourlay," said a voice behind him.</p>

<p>"Ay, nae doubt I'm weel kenned."</p>

<p>"You are in the meantime my prisoner," said an
officer, with the indispensable blue coat, and the red
collar, and the cocked hat.</p>

<p>"For what?" said Geordie.</p>

<p>"Ye'll ken that by and by," replied the officer; "the
fiscal will tell ye. Awa' wi' me to the office."</p>

<p>"Humph! for picking a lock," said the blacksmith.
"The deil put my left fingers between my hammer and
the stiddy when I meddle again wi' rusty padlocks."</p>

<p>"There's naething dune on earth but what is seen,"
said the man, as with something like a smile on his left
cheek, the other retaining its gravity, he held up his
finger as if pointing to heaven.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, there's an e'e there."</p>

<p>"And to break open a house," continued the officer,
"is death en the wuddy up yonder at the 'Auld Heart.'"</p>

<p>"But wha, in God's name, is the witness against me?"</p>

<p>"Guidwife Christian," said the officer again, seriously
enough at least for Geordie's belief of his sincerity.</p>

<p>"And the woman has turned against her husband!
This is the warst blow ava. But, Lord, man, I stowe
naething."</p>

<p>"Thieves are no generally at the trouble of picking
locks, rummaging a house, and going away empty-handed,
as if out o' a kirk. But come, you can tell the
Lord Advocate's deputy a' that."</p>

<p>And George Gourlay was taken away, muttering to
himself, as he went, "This explains a'. Nae wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
she wadna speak to the man she intended to hang.
Woman, woman, verily from the beginning hae ye been
we to man, and will be to the end."</p>

<p>Led up the High Street, yet in such a way as to
avoid any suspicion that he was in the hands of an
officer, George Gourlay was placed safely in the room
of Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, the procurator-fiscal of that time, for
reasons unknown to us, in the Old Tolbooth. The
entry through the thick iron-knobbed door to the inside
of this dark and dreary pile, which borrowed its
light only through openings left by the irregularities
of the high masses of St. Giles, and the parallel rows
of overshadowing houses, flanked by the booths and
the Crames, was enough to vanquish the heart of the
strongest and the most innocent. Nor was it the darkness
and the squalor alone that were so formidable.
Thick air, loaded with the breath and exhalations from
unhealthiness and disease itself, had made livid faces
and bloodshot eyes; drunken, uproarious voices, and
bacchanalian songs, oaths, denunciations, and peals of
laughter, mixed with groans. Only awanting that inscription
seen by the Hermet shadow who led the
Florentine. Up a stair&mdash;through the midst of these
children of evil or victims of misfortune, the innocent
rendered guilty by infection, the condemned to death
made drearily jolly by despair, imitating the recklessness
of mirth,&mdash;and now the unfortunate George
Gourlay is before his examinator.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gourlay," said the officer.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir," said Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, "and wait till the
others come. We cannot want Mrs. Gourlay, though no
doubt you can swear to the man. In the meantime,
hold your peace, lest you commit yourself. Say nothing
till you are asked. Most strange affair."</p>

<p>Thus at once doomed to silence, George sat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
listened to the mixed buzz of this misery become
ludibund. Nor was his unhappiness thus limited: a
fearful conviction seized him, that long before he was
hanged he would take on the likeness of the wretches
he had passed through;&mdash;he would become sleazy;
his eyes would be red, fiery, or bleared with tears,
dried up in the heat of his fevered blood; his cheeks
would be pale-yellow or blue, his voice husky, and his
nose red; he would sing, swear, dance&mdash;ay, douce
Geordie would sing even as they. Better be hanged
at once than sent hence thus deteriorated,&mdash;an unpleasant
customer in the other world. Nay, one half
of them had greasy, furzy, red nightcaps; and the
chance was therefore a half that he would be thrown
off in one of these, to the eternal disgrace of the
Gourlays of Gersholm, from whom he was descended.</p>

<p>A full hour passed, bringing no comfort on its heavy
wings. At length another red-necked official entered,
and introduced guidwife Christian herself, and&mdash;Patrick
Guthrie.</p>

<p>When these parties entered, Geordie's eyes and mouth
had relapsed into that condition they presented on that
occasion when he saw the wraith by the bed with the
green curtains.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gourlay," said Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, "you are the wife
of George Gourlay, blacksmith?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and have been for nine years, come the time,
the day, and the hour."</p>

<p>"Please throw your mind back twenty years."</p>

<p>"It ower aften gaes back to that time o' its ain accord,
sir."</p>

<p>"Well, tell us where you lived, and what you did
about that time."</p>

<p>"I was servant to Mr. Patrick Guthrie,&mdash;this gentleman
sitting at my right hand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was Mr. Guthrie a married man?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, he was married to a young lady, whose
maiden name was Henrietta Douglas, ane o' the Brigstons,
as I hae heard."</p>

<p>"What kind of woman was she?"</p>

<p>"Bonny, sir, as ony that ever walked the High Street
or the Canongate; and the mair wae, sir. Cheerfu',
too, and light-hearted and merry as the lavrock when
it rises in the morning; ay, and the mair wae!"</p>

<p>"Why do you add these words?" continued Mr.
B&mdash;&mdash;. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Because thae things brought gay gallants about the
house when master was awa' in Angus, whaur he had
a property near Gaigie; but he was nane, I think, o'
the four Guthries."</p>

<p>"Then you knew that they came without the knowledge
and against the wishes of your master?"</p>

<p>"Ower weel, sir, for my peace these twenty years
bygane."</p>

<p>"Then you think there was more than indiscretion
in Mrs. Guthrie?"</p>

<p>"Muckle mair, I doubt."</p>

<p>"Do you recollect the names of any of these gay
gallants?"</p>

<p>"There was Lord Spynie, a wild dare-the-deil; but
sae merry, and jovial, and pleasant, that his very een
were nets to catch women's hearts."</p>

<p>"Do you remember anything happening when
Lord Spynie was in the house in Bell's Wynd?"</p>

<p>"Ay; on the last day o' my service, yea, the last
day o' my leddie's life. My maister had gane to Gaigie,
as I thought; but I aye doubted if he had been farther
than the White Horse. He wouldna return for a
week, not he; and so my leddie thought, for the next
day she ordered me to get a goose, and roast it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
spit; and weel I kenned wha the goose was for. But
I didna like the business, for I had my pirns to finish&mdash;no,
gude forgie me, that I was against this deception
o' my master. The goose was bought, and plucket, and
singed, and put to the fire. The dinner was to be at
twa o'clock, and Lord Spynie was there by ane. In
half an hour after, wha comes rushing in but my master?
And the moment he saw Spynie, he drew his sword,
and so did his lordship his. My mistress screamed,
and ran between them; and oh! sir, the sword that
was thrust at Spynie gaed clean through my mistress's
fair body. She was dead. Then Lord Spynie lost a'
his courage, and flew out o' the house; and just as he
was passing through the door, my master thrust at
him, and his bluidy sword snapt and was broken clean
through. He came back and looked on my leddy, and
kissed her, ay, and grat like a bairn; but oh! he was
composed too. 'Christy,' said he, 'lay your mistress on
the green bed.' And so I did, and streeked her, and
drew the coverlet over her, and put a mutch upon her
head. Oh how fair she was in death! 'Christy,' said
master, 'come hither.' I obeyed. 'Get the Bible,' he
said. I got it. 'Get on your knees,' he said. I knelt.
'Here,' said he, 'is twenty gowden guineas; and now
swear upon the Laws and the Prophets, and the four
Gospels, that you will never, by word, or look, or pen,
reveal to man, or woman, or wean what has been done&mdash;in
this house this day.' I swore. 'Now go,' said he;
'for I am to lock up the house, and go far away,
where no man can know me.' So I took my little
trunk, and went away sobbing. Nor was he a moment
after me. I saw him shut the shutters and lock the
door, and walk quickly away. Nor was he ever heard
of more till yesterday; and there he is."</p>

<p>"Is all this true, Mr. Guthrie?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"All true as God's word."</p>

<p>"And all this happened twenty years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then by the law of Scotland you are a free man,
even were this murder or homicide; for twenty years
is the period of our prescription. You may all go."</p>

<p>Then they rose to depart.</p>

<p>"Mr. Guthrie," cried Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, "bury your wife.
And, hark ye, the goose has been at the fire for twenty
years, and must now, I think, be roasted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_PRODIGAL_SON" id="THE_PRODIGAL_SON"></a>THE PRODIGAL SON.</h2>


<p>The early sun was melting away the coronets of grey
clouds on the brows of the mountains, and the lark, as
if proud of its plumage, and surveying itself in an
illuminated mirror, carolled over the bright water of
Keswick, when two strangers met upon the side of the
lofty Skiddaw. Each carried a small bag and a hammer,
betokening that their common errand was to search for
objects of geological interest. The one appeared about
fifty, the other some twenty years younger. There is
something in the solitude of the everlasting hills, which
makes men who are strangers to each other despise
the ceremonious introductions of the drawing-room.
So it was with our geologists&mdash;their place of meeting,
their common pursuit, produced an instantaneous
familiarity. They spent the day, and dined on the
mountain-side together. They shared the contents of
their flasks with each other; and, ere they began to
descend the hill, they felt, the one towards the other, as
though they had been old friends. They had begun to
take the road towards Keswick, when the elder said to
the younger, "My meeting with you to-day recalls to my
recollection a singular meeting which took place between
a friend of mine and a stranger, about seven years ago,
upon the same mountain. But, sir, I will relate to you
the circumstances connected with it; and they might
be called the History of the Prodigal Son."</p>

<p>He paused for a few moments, and proceeded:&mdash;About
thirty years ago a Mr. Fen-wick was possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of property in Bamboroughshire worth about three
hundred per annum. He had married while young,
and seven fair children cheered the hearth of a glad
father and a happy mother. Many years of joy and of
peace had flown over them, when Death visited their
domestic circle, and passed his icy hand over the
cheek of the first-born; and, for five successive years,
as their children opened into manhood and womanhood,
the unwelcome visitor entered their dwelling, till of
their little flock there was but one, the youngest, left.
And O, sir, in the leaving of that one, lay the cruelty
of Death&mdash;to have taken him, too, would have been an
act of mercy. His name was Edward; and the love, the
fondness, and the care which his parents had borne for
all their children, were concentrated on him. His
father, whose soul was stricken with affliction, yielded
to his every wish; and his poor mother</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"Would not permit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The winds of heaven to visit his cheek too roughly."</span><br />
</p>

<p>But you shall hear how cruelly he repaid their love&mdash;how
murderously he returned their kindness. He was
headstrong and wayward; and though the small still
voice of affection was never wholly silent in his breast,
it was stifled by the storm of his passions and propensities.
His first manifestation of open viciousness
was a delight in the brutal practice of cock-fighting;
and he became a constant attender at every "<i>main</i>"
that took place at Northumberland. He was a habitual
"<i>bettor</i>," and his losses were frequent; but hitherto
his father, partly through fear, and partly from a too
tender affection, had supplied him with money. A
"main" was to take place in the neighbourhood of
Morpeth, and he was present. Two noble birds were
disfigured, the savage instruments of death were fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
upon them, and they were pitted against each other.
"A hundred to one on the Felton Grey!" shouted
Fen-wick. "Done! for guineas!" replied another.
"Done! for guineas!&mdash;done!" repeated the prodigal&mdash;and
the next moment the Felton Grey lay dead on
the ground, pierced through the skull with the spur of
the other. He rushed out of the cockpit&mdash;"I shall
expect payment to-morrow, Fen-wick," cried the other.
The prodigal mounted his horse, and rode homeward
with the fury of a madman. Kind as his father was,
and had been, he feared to meet him or tell him the
amount of his loss. His mother perceived his agony,
and strove to soothe him.</p>

<p>"What is't that troubles thee, my bird?" inquired
she. "Come, tell thy mother, darling."</p>

<p>With an oath he cursed the mention of birds, and
threatened to destroy himself.</p>

<p>"O Edward, love! thou wilt kill thy poor mother.
What can I do for thee?"</p>

<p>"Do for me!" he exclaimed, wildly tearing his hair
as he spoke&mdash;"do for me, mother. Get me a hundred
pounds, or my heart's blood shall flow at your feet."</p>

<p>"Child! child!" said she, "thou hast been at thy
black trade of betting again. Thou wilt ruin thy
father, Edward, and break thy mother's heart. But
give me thy hand on't, dear, that thou'lt bet no more,
and I'll get thy father to give thee the money."</p>

<p>"My father must not know," he exclaimed; "I will
die rather."</p>

<p>"Love! love!" replied she; "but, without asking thy
father, where could I get thee a hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>"You have some money, mother," added he; "and
you have trinkets&mdash;jewellery!" he gasped, and hid his
face as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have them!&mdash;thou shalt have them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
child!" said she, "and all the money thy mother has&mdash;only
say thou wilt bet no more. Dost thou promise,
Edward&mdash;oh, dost thou promise thy poor mother
this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he cried. And he burst into tears as he
spoke.</p>

<p>He received the money, and the trinkets, which his
mother had not worn for thirty years, and hurried from
the house, and with them discharged a portion of his
dishonourable debt.</p>

<p>He, however, did bet again; and I might tell you
how he became a horse-racer also; but you shall hear
that too. He was now about two-and-twenty, and for
several years he had been acquainted with Eleanor
Robinson&mdash;a fair being, made up of gentleness and
love, if ever woman was. She was an orphan, and had
a fortune at her own disposal of three thousand pounds.
Her friends had often warned her against the dangerous
habits of Edward Fen-wick. But she had given
him her young heart&mdash;to him she had plighted her
first vow&mdash;and, though she beheld his follies, she
trusted that time and affection would wean him from
them; and, with a heart full of hope and love, she bestowed
on him her hand and fortune. Poor Eleanor!
her hopes were vain, her love unworthily bestowed.
Marriage produced no change on the habits of the
prodigal son and thoughtless husband. For weeks he
was absent from his own house, betting and carousing
with his companions of the turf; while one vice led the
way to another, and, by almost imperceptible degrees,
he unconsciously sunk into all the habits of a profligate.</p>

<p>It was about four years after his marriage, when,
according to his custom, he took leave of his wife for
a few days, to attend the meeting at Doncaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, Eleanor, dear," he said gaily, as he rose
to depart, and kissed her cheek; "I shall be back
within five days."</p>

<p>"Well, Edward," said she, tenderly, "if you will go,
you must; but think of me, and think of these our little
ones." And, with a tear in her eye, she desired a lovely
boy and girl to kiss their father. "Now, think of us,
Edward," she added; "and do not bet, dearest, do not
bet!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, duck! nonsense!" said he; "did you ever
see me lose?&mdash;do you suppose that Ned Fen-wick is not
'wide awake?' I know my horse, and its rider too&mdash;Barrymore's
Highlander can distance everything.
But, if it could not, I have it from a sure hand&mdash;the
other horses are all '<i>safe</i>.' Do you understand that&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not understand it, Edward, nor do I wish
to understand it," added she; "but, dearest, as you love
me&mdash;as you love our children&mdash;risk nothing."</p>

<p>"Love you, little gipsy! you know I'd die for you,"
said he&mdash;and, with all his sins, the prodigal spoke the
truth. "Come, Nell, kiss me again, my dear&mdash;no long
faces&mdash;don't take a leaf out of my old mother's book;
you know the saying, 'Never venture, never win&mdash;faint
heart never won fair ladye!' Good-bye, love&mdash;'bye,
Ned&mdash;good-bye, mother's darling," said he, addressing
the children as he left the house.</p>

<p>He reached Doncaster; he had paid his guinea for
admission to the betting-rooms; he had whispered
with, and slipped a fee to all the shrivelled, skin-and-bone,
half-melted little manikins, called jockeys, to
ascertain the secrets of their horses. "All's safe!" said
the prodigal to himself, rejoicing in his heart. The
great day of the festival&mdash;the important St. Leger&mdash;arrived.
Hundreds were ready to back Highlander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
against the field: amongst them was Edward Fen-wick;
he would take any odds&mdash;he did take them&mdash;he staked
his all. "A thousand to five hundred on Highlander
against the field," he cried, as he stood near a betting-post.
"Done!" shouted a mustachioed peer of the
realm, in a barouche by his side. "Done!" cried Fen-wick,
"for the double, if you like, my lord." "Done!"
added the peer; "and I'll treble it if you dare!"
"Done!" rejoined the prodigal, in the confidence and
excitement of the moment&mdash;"Done! my lord." The
eventful hour arrived. There was not a false start.
The horses took the ground beautifully. Highlander
led the way at his ease; and his rider, in a tartan
jacket and mazarine cap, looked confident. Fen-wick
stood near the winning-post, grasping the rails with his
hands; he was still confident, but he could not chase
the admonition of his wife from his mind. The horses
were not to be seen. His very soul became like a solid
and sharp-edged substance within his breast. Of the
twenty horses that started, four again appeared in sight.
"The tartan yet! the tartan yet!" shouted the crowd.
Fen-wick raised his eyes&mdash;he was blind with anxiety&mdash;he
could not discern them; still he heard the cry of
"The tartan! the tartan!" and his heart sprang to his
mouth. "Well done, orange!&mdash;the orange will have
it!" was the next cry. He again looked up, but he
was more blind than before. "Beautiful!&mdash;beautiful!
Go it, tartan! Well done, orange!" shouted the
spectators; "a noble race!&mdash;neck and neck; six to
five on the orange!" He became almost deaf as well
as blind. "Now for it!&mdash;now for it!&mdash;it won't do,
tartan!&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;orange has it!"</p>

<p>"Liar!" exclaimed Fen-wick, starting as if from a
trance, and grasping the spectator who stood next him
by the throat&mdash;"I am not ruined!"&mdash;In a moment he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
dropped his hands by his side, he leaned over the railing,
and gazed vacantly on the ground. His flesh
writhed, and his soul groaned in agony. "Eleanor!&mdash;my
poor Eleanor!" cried the prodigal. The crowd
hurried towards the winning-post&mdash;he was left alone.
The peer with whom he had betted, came behind him;
he touched him on the shoulder with his whip&mdash;"Well,
my covey," said the nobleman, "you have lost it."</p>

<p>Fen-wick gazed on him with a look of fury and despair,
and repeated&mdash;"Lost it!&mdash;I am ruined&mdash;soul and
body!&mdash;wife and children ruined!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Fen-wick," said the sporting peer, "I suppose,
if that be the case, you won't come to Doncaster
again in a hurry. But my settling day is to-morrow&mdash;you
know I keep sharp accounts; and if you have not
the '<i>ready</i>' at hand, I shall expect an equivalent&mdash;you
understand me."</p>

<p>So saying, he rode off, leaving the prodigal to commit
suicide if he chose. It is enough for me to tell you
that, in his madness and his misery, and from the influence
of what he called his sense of honour, he gave
the winner a bill for the money&mdash;payable at sight.
My feelings will not permit me to tell you how the poor
infatuated madman more than once made attempts upon
his own life; but the latent love of his wife and of his
children prevailed over the rash thought, and, in a state
bordering on insanity, he presented himself before the
beings he had so deeply injured.</p>

<p>I might describe to you how poor Eleanor was sitting
in their little parlour, with her boy upon a stool by her
side, and her little girl on her knee, telling them fondly
that their father would be home soon, and anon singing
to them the simple nursery rhyme&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Hush, my babe, baby bunting,<br />
Your father's at the hunting," etc.;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>when the door opened, and the guilty father entered,
his hair clotted, his eyes rolling with the wildness of
despair, and the cold sweat running down his pale
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Eleanor! Eleanor!" he cried, as he flung himself
upon a sofa.</p>

<p>She placed her little daughter on the floor&mdash;she flew
towards him&mdash;"My Edward!&mdash;oh my Edward!" she
cried&mdash;"what is it, love?&mdash;something troubles you."</p>

<p>"Curse me, Eleanor!" exclaimed the wretched prodigal,
turning his face from her. "I have ruined you I&mdash;I
have ruined my children!&mdash;I am lost for ever!"</p>

<p>"No, my husband!" exclaimed the best of wives;
"your Eleanor will not curse you. Tell me the worst,
and I will bear it&mdash;cheerfully bear it, for my Edward's
sake."</p>

<p>"You will not&mdash;you cannot," cried he; "I have sinned
against you as never man sinned against woman. Oh!
if you would spit upon the very ground where I tread,
I would feel it as an alleviation of my sufferings; but
your sympathy, your affection, makes my very soul destroy
itself! Eleanor!&mdash;Eleanor-!&mdash;if you have mercy,
hate me&mdash;tell me&mdash;show me that you do!"</p>

<p>"O Edward!" said she, imploringly, "was it thus
when your Eleanor spurned every offer for your sake,
when you pledged to her everlasting love? She has
none but you, and can you speak thus? O husband!
if you will forsake <i>me</i>, forsake not my poor children&mdash;tell
me! only tell me the worst&mdash;and I will rejoice to
endure it with my Edward!"</p>

<p>"Then," cried Fen-wick, "if you will add to my misery
by professing to love a wretch like me&mdash;know you are
a beggar!&mdash;and I have made you one! Now, can you
share beggary with me?"</p>

<p>She repeated the word "Beggary!"&mdash;she clasped her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
hands together&mdash;for a few moments she stood in silent
anguish&mdash;her bosom heaved&mdash;the tears gushed forth&mdash;she
flung her arms around her husband's neck&mdash;"Yes!"
she cried, "I can meet even beggary with my Edward!"</p>

<p>"O Heaven!" cried the prodigal, "would that the
earth would swallow me! I cannot stand this!"</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon the endeavours of the fond,
forgiving wife, to soothe and to comfort her unworthy
husband; nor yet will I describe to you the anguish of
the prodigal's father and of his mother, when they heard
the extent of his folly and of his guilt. Already he had
cost the old man much, and, with a heavy and sorrowful
heart, he proceeded to his son's house to comfort his
daughter-in-law. When he entered, she was endeavouring
to cheer her husband with a tune upon the
harpsichord&mdash;though, Heaven knows, there was no
music in her breast, save that of love&mdash;enduring love!</p>

<p>"Well, Edward," said the old man, as he took a seat,
"what is this that thou hast done now?"</p>

<p>The prodigal was silent.</p>

<p>"Edward," continued the grey-haired parent, "I have
had deaths in my family&mdash;many deaths, and thou knowest
it&mdash;but I never had to blush for a child but thee! I
have felt sorrow, but thou hast added shame to sorrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O father!" cried Eleanor, imploringly, "do not upbraid
my poor husband."</p>

<p>The old man wept&mdash;he pressed her hand, and, with
a groan, said, "I am ashamed that thou shouldst call
me father, sweetest; but if thou canst forgive him, I
should. He is all that is left to me&mdash;all that the hand
of death has spared me in this world! Yet, Eleanor,
his conduct is a living death to me&mdash;it is worse than
all that I have suffered. When affliction pressed
heavily upon me, and, year after year, I followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
my dear children to the grave, my neighbours sympathized
with me&mdash;they mingled their tears with mine;
but now, child&mdash;oh, now, I am ashamed to hold up my
head amongst them! O Edward, man! if thou hast
no regard for thy father or thy heart-broken mother,
hast thou no affection for thy poor wife?&mdash;canst thou
bring her and thy helpless children to ruin? But that,
I may say, thou hast done already! Son! son! if thou
wilt murder thy parents, hast thou no mercy for thine
own flesh and blood?&mdash;wilt thou destroy thine own
offspring? O Edward! if there be any sin that I will
repent upon my death-bed, it will be that I have been
a too indulgent father to thee&mdash;that I am the author of
thy crimes!"</p>

<p>"No, father! no!" cried the prodigal; "my sins are
my own! I am their author, and my soul carries its
own punishment! Spurn me! cast me off!&mdash;disown
me for ever!&mdash;it is all I ask of you! You despise me&mdash;hate
me too, and I will be less miserable!"</p>

<p>"O Edward!" said the old man, "thou art a father,
but little dost thou know a father's heart! Disown
thee! Cast thee off, sayest thou! As soon could the
graves of thy brothers give up their dead! Never,
Edward! never! O son, wouldst thou but reform thy
ways&mdash;wouldst thou but become a husband worthy of
our dear Eleanor; and, after all the suffering thou hast
brought upon her, and the shame thou hast brought
upon thy family, I would part with my last shilling for
thee, Edward, though I should go into the workhouse
myself."</p>

<p>You are affected, sir&mdash;I will not harrow up your
feelings by further describing the interview between
the father and his son. The misery of the prodigal was
remorse, not penitence. It is sufficient for me to say,
that the old man took a heavy mortgage on his pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>perty,
and Edward Fen-wick commenced business as a
wine and spirit merchant in Newcastle. But, sir, he
did not attend upon business; and I need not tell you
that such being the case, business was too proud a
customer to attend upon him. Neither did he forsake
his old habits, and, within two years, he became involved&mdash;deeply
involved. Already, to sustain his tottering
credit, his father had been brought to the verge of
ruin. During his residence in Bamboroughshire, he
had become acquainted with many individuals carrying
on a contraband trade with Holland. To amend
his desperate fortunes, he recklessly embarked in it.
In order to obtain a part in the ownership of a lugger,
he <i>used his father's name</i>! This was the crowning evil
in the prodigal's drama. He made the voyage himself.
They were pursued and overtaken when attempting to
effect a landing near the Coquet. He escaped. But
the papers of the vessel bespoke her as being chiefly the
property of his father. Need I tell you that this was
a finishing blow to the old man?</p>

<p>Edward Fen-wick had ruined his wife and family&mdash;he
had brought ruin upon his father, and was himself
a fugitive. He was pursued by the law; he fled from
them; and he would have fled from their remembrance
if he could. It was now, sir, that the wrath of Heaven
was showered upon the head, and began to touch the
heart of the prodigal: Like Cain, he was a fugitive
and a vagabond on the face of the earth. For many
months he wandered in a distant part of the country;
his body was emaciated and clothed with rags, and
hunger preyed upon his very heart-strings. It is a
vulgar thing, sir, to talk of hunger; but they who have
never felt it know not what it means. He was fainting
by the wayside, his teeth were grating together, the
tears were rolling down his cheeks. "The servants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
my father's house," he cried, "have bread enough and
to spare, while I perish with hunger;" and continuing
the language of the prodigal in the Scriptures, he said,
"I will arise and go unto my father, and say, I have
sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight."</p>

<p>With a slow and tottering step, he arose to proceed
on his journey to his father's house. A month had
passed&mdash;for every day he made less progress&mdash;ere the
home of his infancy appeared in sight. It was noon,
and, when he saw it, he sat down in a little wood by a
hill-side and wept, until it had become dusk; for he
was ashamed of his rags. He drew near the house, but
none came forth to welcome him. With a timid hand
he rapped at the door, but none answered him. A
stranger came from one of the outhouses and inquired,
"What dost thou want, man?"</p>

<p>"Mr Fen-wick," feebly answered the prodigal.</p>

<p>"Why, naebody lives there," said the other; "and
auld Fen-wick died in Morpeth jail mair than three
months sin'!"</p>

<p>"Died in Morpeth jail!" groaned the miserable being,
and fell against the door of the house that had been his
father's.</p>

<p>"I tell ye, ye cannot get in there," continued the
other.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Edward, "pity me; and, oh, tell me
is Mrs Fen-wick here&mdash;or her daughter-in-law?"</p>

<p>"I know nought about them," said the stranger.
"I'm put in charge here by the trustees."</p>

<p>Want and misery kindled all their fires in the breast
of the fugitive. He groaned, and, partly from exhaustion,
partly from agony, sank upon the ground. The
other lifted him to a shed, where cattle were wont to
be fed. His lips were parched, his languid eyes rolled
vacantly. "Water! give me water!" he muttered in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
feeble voice; and a cup of water was brought to him.
He gazed wistfully in the face of the person who stood
over him&mdash;he would have asked for bread; but, in the
midst of his sufferings, pride was yet strong in his heart,
and he could not. The stranger, however, was not
wholly destitute of humanity.</p>

<p>"Poor wretch!" said he, "ye look very fatigued;
dow ye think ye cud eat a bit bread, if I were gi'en it
to thee?"</p>

<p>Tears gathered in the lustreless eyes of the prodigal;
but he could not speak. The stranger left him, and
returning, placed a piece of coarse bread in his hand.
He ate a morsel; but his very soul was sick, and his
heart loathed to receive the food for lack of which he
was perishing.</p>

<p>Vain, sir, were the inquiries after his wife, his children,
and his mother; all that he could learn was, that
they had kept their sorrow and their shame to themselves,
and had left Northumberland together, but
where, none knew. He also learned that it was
understood amongst his acquaintances that he had
put a period to his existence, and that this belief
was entertained by his family. Months of wretchedness
followed, and Fen-wick, in despair, enlisted into
a foot regiment, which, within twelve months, was
ordered to embark for Egypt. At that period the
British were anxious to hide the remembrance of their
unsuccessful attack upon Cadiz, and resolved to wrench
the ancient kingdom of the Pharaohs from the grasp of
the proud armies of Napoleon. The Cabinet, therefore,
on the surrender of Malta, having seconded the views
of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, several transports were
fitted out to join the squadron under Lord Keith. In
one of those transports the penitent prodigal embarked.
You are too young to remember it, sir; but at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
period a love of country was more widely than ever
becoming the ruling passion of every man in Britain;
and, with all his sins, his follies, and his miseries, such
a feeling glowed in the breast of Edward Fen-wick.
He was weary of existence, and he longed to listen to
the neighing of the war-horse, and the shout of its rider,
and as they might rush on the invulnerable phalanx,
and its breastwork of bayonets, to mingle in the rank
of heroes; and, rather than pine in inglorious grief, to
sell his life for the welfare of his country; or, like the
gallant Graham, amidst the din of war, and the confusion
of glory, to forget his sorrows. The regiment to which
he belonged joined the main army off the Bay of Marmorice,
and was the first that, with the gallant Moore
at its head, on the memorable seventh of March, raised
the shout of victory on the shores of Aboukir.</p>

<p>In the moment of victory, Fen-wick fell wounded on
the field, and his comrades, in their triumph, passed
over him. He had some skill in surgery, and he was
enabled to bind up his wound. He was fainting upon
the burning sand, and he was creeping amongst the
bodies of the slain, for a drop of moisture to cool his
parched tongue, when he perceived a small bottle in
the hands of a dead officer. It was half-filled with
wine&mdash;he eagerly raised it to his lips&mdash;"Englishman!"
cried a feeble voice, "for the love of Heaven! give me
one drop&mdash;only one!&mdash;or I die!" He looked around&mdash;a
French officer, apparently in the agonies of death,
was vainly endeavouring to raise himself on his side,
and stretching his hand towards him. "Why should
I live?" cried the wretched prodigal; "take it, take it,
and live, if you desire life!" He raised the wounded
Frenchman's head from the sand&mdash;he placed the bottle
to his lips&mdash;he untied his sash, and bound up his
wounds. The other pressed his hand in gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
They were conveyed from the field together. Fen-wick
was unable to follow the army, and he was disabled
from continuing in the service. The French officer
recovered, and he was grateful for the poor service
that had been rendered to him; and, previous to his
being sent off with other prisoners, he gave a present of
a thousand francs to the joyless being whom he called
his deliverer.</p>

<p>I have told you that Fen-wick had some skill in
surgery; he had studied some years for the medical
profession, but abandoned it for the turf and its vices.
He proceeded to Alexandria, where he began to practise
as a surgeon, and, amongst an ignorant people,
gained reputation. Many years passed, and he had
acquired, if not riches, at least an independency. Repentance
also had penetrated his soul. He had inquired
long and anxiously after his family. He had but few
other relatives; and to all of them he had anxiously
written, imploring them to acquaint him with the
residence of the beings whom he had brought to ruin,
but whom he still loved. Some returned no answer to
his applications, and others only said that they knew
nothing of his wife, or his mother, or of his children,
nor whether they yet lived; all they knew was, that
they had endeavoured to hide the shame he had
brought upon them from the world. These words
were daggers to his bruised spirit; but he knew he
deserved them, and he prayed that Heaven would grant
him the consolation and the mercy that were denied him
on earth.</p>

<p>Somewhat more than seven years ago he returned
to his native country, and he was wandering on the
very mountain where, to-day, I met you, when he
entered into conversation with a youth apparently
about three or four and twenty years of age; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
spent the day together as we have done. Fen-wick
was lodging in Keswick, and as, towards evening, they
proceeded along the road together, they were overtaken
by a storm. "You must accompany me home,"
said the young man, "until the storm be passed; my
mother's house is at hand,"&mdash;and he conducted him
to yonder lonely cottage, whose white walls you perceive
peering through the trees by the water-side. It
was dusk when the youth ushered him into a little
parlour where two ladies sat; the one appeared about
forty, the other threescore and ten. They welcomed
the stranger graciously. He ascertained that they let
out the rooms of their cottage to visitors to the lakes
during the summer season. He expressed a wish to
become their lodger, and made some observations on
the beauty of the situation.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the younger lady, "the situation is
indeed beautiful; but I have seen it when the water,
and the mountains around it, could impart no charm
to its dwellers. Providence has, indeed, been kind to
us, and our lodgings have seldom been empty; but,
sir, when we entered it, it was a sad house indeed.
My poor mother-in-law and myself had experienced
many sorrows; yet my poor fatherless children&mdash;for I
might call them fatherless"&mdash;and she wept as she spoke&mdash;"with
their innocent prattle, soothed our affliction.
But my little Eleanor, who was loved by every one,
began to droop day by day. It was a winter night&mdash;the
snow was on the ground&mdash;I heard my little darling
give a deep sigh upon my bosom. I started up. I
called to my poor mother. She brought a light to the
bedside&mdash;and I found my sweet child dead upon my
breast. It was a long and sad night, as we sat by the
dead body of my Eleanor, with no one near us; and
after she <b>was</b> buried, my poor Edward there, as he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
by our side at night, would draw forward to his knee
the stool on which his sister sat&mdash;while his grandmother
would glance at him fondly, and push aside the stool
with her foot, that I might not see it;&mdash;but I saw it
all."</p>

<p>The twilight had deepened in the little parlour, and
its inmates could not perfectly distinguish the features
of each other; but as the lady spoke, the soul of Edward
Fen-wick glowed within him&mdash;his heart throbbed&mdash;his
breathing became thick&mdash;the sweat burst upon
his brow. "Pardon me, lady!" he cried, in agony;
"but, oh! tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"Fen-wick, sir," replied she.</p>

<p>"Eleanor! my injured Eleanor!" he exclaimed, flinging
himself at her feet. "I am Edward, your guilty
husband! Mother! can you forgive me? My son!
my son! intercede for your guilty father!"</p>

<p>Ah, sir, there needed no intercession&mdash;their arms
were around his neck&mdash;the prodigal was forgiven!
"Behold," continued the narrator, "yonder from the
cottage comes the mother, the wife, and the son of
whom I have spoken! I will introduce you to them&mdash;you
shall witness the happiness and the penitence of
the prodigal&mdash;you must stop with me to-night. Start
not, sir&mdash;I am Edward Fen-wick the Prodigal Son!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAWYERS_TALES" id="THE_LAWYERS_TALES"></a>THE LAWYER'S TALES.</h2>

<h3>THE WOMAN WITH THE WHITE MICE.</h3>


<p>Many have, doubtless, both heard and read of the case
of murder in which Jeffrey performed his greatest feat
of oratory and power over a jury, and in which, while
engaged in his grand speech of more than six hours,
he caught, from an open window, the aphony which
threatened to close up his voice for ever afterwards.
I have had occasion to notice the wants in reported
cases tried before courts; and in reference to the one
I have now mentioned, I have reason, from my inquiries,
to know that the most curious details of the
transaction are not only not to be found in the report,
but not even suggested, if they do not, in some particulars,
appear to be opposed to the public testimony.
The agent of the panel sits behind the counsel, delivering
to him sometimes very crude materials for the
defence, and the counsel sifts that matter; sometimes
taking a handful of the chaff to blind a juryman or
a judge, but more often casting it away as either useless
or dangerous. In that unused chaff there are often
pickles not of the kind put into the sack, and again
laid as an offering before the blind goddess, but of
a different kind of grain&mdash;nor often less pleasant, or,
if applied, less acceptable to justice.</p>

<p>In a certain month in the year 18&mdash;, a writer in
Dundee, of the name of David M&mdash;&mdash;, was busy in
his office, in a dark street off the High Street&mdash;busy,
no doubt, in discharging the functions of that office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
represented by Æsop as occupied by a monkey, holding
the scales between the litigating cats. He heard
a horse stop at his office door, as if brought suddenly
up by a jerk of the rein.</p>

<p>"There is haste here," he thought; "what is up?"</p>

<p>And presently the door opened, and there came,
or rather rushed, in a man, of the appearance of a
country farmer, greatly more excited than these douce
men generally are&mdash;except, perhaps, in the midst of a
plentiful harvest-home&mdash;splashed up with mud to the
back of the neck, and breathing as hard as, no doubt,
the horse was that carried him.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;?" inquired the writer, as he
looked at his client.</p>

<p>"A dreadful business!" replied he; and he turned,
went back to the door, shut it, and tested the hold
of the lock; then laying down his hat and whip, and
pulling off his big-coat, he drew a chair so near the
writer, that the man of law, <i>brusque</i> and even jolly
as he was, instinctively withdrew his, as if he feared
an appeal for money.</p>

<p>"What is the business?" again asked the writer, as
he saw the man in a spasmodic difficulty to begin.</p>

<p>"We are all ruined at D&mdash;&mdash;!" he at length said;
"Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is in your jail, hard by, on a charge of
murder."</p>

<p>"Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;! of all the women in the world!" ejaculated
the writer in unfeigned amazement: "murder of
whom?"</p>

<p>"Of a servant at D&mdash;&mdash;," replied Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;; "one
of our own women."</p>

<p>"And what could be the motive?"</p>

<p>"The young woman," continued S&mdash;&mdash;, "had been
observed to be pregnant, and the report was got up
that my son was the party responsible and blameable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Then the charge is, that my wife gave the girl poison,
either to procure abortion, or to take away her life.
The woman is dead and buried; but, I believe, her
body has been taken up out of the grave and examined,
and poison found in the stomach."</p>

<p>"An ugly account," said the writer. "I mean not
ugly as regards the evidence, of which, as yet, I have
heard nothing. I could say beforehand that I don't
believe the authorities will be able to bring home an
act of this kind to so rational and respectable a woman,
as I have known Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;to be; but if you wish
me to get her off, you must allow me to look at the
case as if she were guilty."</p>

<p>"Guilty!" echoed the man, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Yes. Were I to go fumbling about in an affair
of this kind, acting upon a notion&mdash;whatever I may
think or feel&mdash;that Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, though your wife,
<i>could not</i> possibly do an act of that kind, I would
neither hound up, as I ought, the investigations of
the prosecutor, nor get up proper evidence&mdash;not to
meet their proofs only, but to overturn them."</p>

<p>"I would have thought you would have been keener
to get off an innocent person&mdash;a wife, and the mother
of a family, too&mdash;than a guilty one," said S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"We cannot get you people to understand these
things," replied the writer; "but so it is, at least with
me, and I rather think a good number of my brethren.
We have a pride in getting off a guilty person; whereas
we have only a spice of satisfaction in saving an innocent
one. Perhaps I have an object, for your own
sake, in speaking thus frankly to you; and I tell you
at once, that if you intend to help me to get off your
wife, you must, as soon as you can&mdash;even here, at this
moment&mdash;renounce all blind confidence in her innocence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Terrible condition!" said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Not pleasant, but useful. How, in God's name,
am I to know how to doctor, purge, or scarify, or
anoint a testimony against you, unless I know that it
exists, and where to find it?"</p>

<p>"Very true," rejoined the farmer, trying to follow
the clever "limb."</p>

<p>"Don't hesitate. I will have more pleasure, and not,
maybe, much less hope, in hearing you detail all the
grounds of your suspicion against your wife, than in
listening to your nasaling and canting about her innocence.
All this is for your good, my dear sir, take it
as you will."</p>

<p>"I believe it," said the farmer, "and will try to act
up to what you say; but I cannot, of my own knowledge,
say much, as yet. These things are done
privately, within the house, and a farmer is mostly out
of doors."</p>

<p>"Well, away, get access to your wife, ferret everything
out of her, as well for her as against her. If she
bought poison, where she bought it, what rats were to
be poisoned, how it was applied, how she communicated
with the girl, and where, and all, and everything you
can gather. Question your servants all they saw or
heard; your son, what he has to say; ascertain who
came about the house, how affected towards the girl,
whether there were more lovers than your son, whether
the girl was melancholy, or hopeful, and likely to do
the thing or not; but, above all, keep it ever in view
that your wife is in prison, and suspected, and let me
know every item you can bring against her. Away,
and lose no time, for I see it's a matter of neck and
neck between her and the prosecutor, and, consequently,
neck and noose, or neck and no noose, between her
and the hangman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Utterly confounded by this array of instructions, the
poor farmer sat and looked blank. It was impossible
he could remember all he had been requested to do;
and the duty of finding out facts to criminate the wife
who had lived with him so long in love and confidence,
bore down upon him with a weight he could hardly
sustain.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," he said.</p>

<p>"You must do <i>more</i> than you can," said the writer;
"but, again I say, let me know every, the smallest item
you can discover against your wife."</p>

<p>And, thus charged, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; mounted his horse,
and rode home to a miserable house with a miserable
heart.</p>

<p>Extraordinary as the case was, it was entrusted to
the charge of an extraordinary man, well remembered
yet throughout that county, and much beyond it. In
personal respects he was strong, broad, and muscular,
with a florid countenance never out of humour, and an
eye that flashed in so many different directions, that it
was impossible to arrest it for two moments at a time.
All action, nothing resisted him; all impulse and sensibility,
nothing escaped his observation; yet no one
could say that any subject retained his mind for more
time than would have sufficed another merely to glance
at it. He could speak to a hundred men in a day upon
a hundred topics, and sit down and run off twenty
pages of a paper without an hour of previous meditation;
break off at a pronoun, at a call to the further
end of the town; drink as much in a few minutes' conversation
with a client as would have taken another an
hour to enjoy, and return and finish his paper in less
time than another would take to think of it. Always,
to appearance, off his guard, he was always master of
his position, nor could any obstacle make him stand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
calculate its dimensions&mdash;it must be surmounted or
broken, if his head or the laws should be broken with
it; always pressing, he never seemed to be impressed,
and the gain or loss of a case was equally indifferent to
him. His passion was action, his desire money; but
the money went as it came&mdash;made without effort and
spent without reason. Yet no man hated him; most
loved him; few admired him; and even those he might
injure by his apparent recklessness could not resist the
good nature by which he warded off every attack.</p>

<p>He saw at once, after he had dismissed S&mdash;&mdash;, that
he had got hold of a desperate case, and also that he
behoved to have recourse to desperate means; but it
seemed to take no grip of his mind for more than a
few minutes, by the end of which he was full swing in
some other matter of business, to be followed with the
same rapidity by something else, and, probably, after
that, pleasure till three in the morning, when he would
be carried home to an elegant house in a certain species
of carriage with one wheel. Nor had even that consummation
any effect on to-morrow's avocations, for
which he would be ready at the earliest hour; and in
this case he <i>was</i> ready. He set about his inquiries,
first proceeded to D&mdash;&mdash; to get a view of the premises&mdash;the
room where the young woman lay, where the
son slept, and the bedroom of the mother&mdash;and ascertain
whether the premises permitted of intercourse with
the servants unknown to the farmer and his wife. He
next began his precognition of those connected with the
house, and, on returning to town, procured access to
Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The jail of Dundee was at that time over the courthouse,
a miserable den of a few dark rooms, presenting
the appearance of displenished garrets, with small
grated windows and a few benches. Here the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sat revolving, no doubt, in her mind all the events of a
life of comfort and respectability, and now under the
risk of being brought to a termination by her body
being suspended in the front of that building where
she had seen before this terrible consummation of
justice enacted with the familiar and dismal forms of
the tragedy of the gallows. We write of these things
as parrots gabble, we read of them as monkeys ogle the,
to them, strange actions of human beings; but what is
all that comes by the eye or the ear of the experiences
of an exterior spirit to the workings of that spirit in
its own interior world, where thought follows thought
with endless ramifications, weaving and interweaving
scenes of love and joy and pain, contrasting and mixing,
dissolving and remixing&mdash;bright lights and dark shadows&mdash;all
seen through the blue-tinged and distorting lens
of present shame? We cannot realize these things, nor
did the writer try. He had only the practical work to
do&mdash;if possible, to get this woman's neck kept out of a
kench; nor did it signify much to him how that was
effected; but effected it would be, if the invention of
one man could do it, and if that failed, and the woman
was suspended, it would trouble him no more than
would the loss of a small-debt case.</p>

<p>"Sorry to see you in this infernal place, Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;,"
he said, as he threw himself upon a bench. "I must
get you out, that's certain; but I can promise you that
certainty only upon the condition of making a clean
breast&mdash;only to me, you know."</p>

<p>"I know only that I never poisoned the woman,"
replied she.</p>

<p>"Do you want to be hanged?" said he, with the
reckless abruptness so peculiar a feature of his character,
at the same time taking a rapid glance of her
demeanour. He knew all about the firmness derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
from the confidence of innocence, of which a certain
class of rhapsodists make so much in a heroic way, and
yet he had always entertained the heterodoxical notion
that guilt is a firmer and often more composed condition
than innocence, inasmuch as his experience led
him to know that the latter is shaky, anxious, and
sensitive, and the former stern and imperturbable.
Nor did his quick mind want reasons for showing that
such ought, by natural laws, to be the case; for it is
never to be lost sight of, that, in so far as regards
murder, which requires for its perpetration a peculiar
form of mind and a most unnatural condition of the
feelings, the same hardness of nerve which enables a
man or woman to do the deed, serves equally well the
purpose of helping them to stand up against the shame,
while the innocent person, in nine hundred and ninety-nine
cases out of a thousand&mdash;the probable proportion
of those who <i>cannot</i> kill&mdash;has not the fortitude to
withstand the ignominy, simply because he wants the
power to slay. So without in his heart prejudging
the woman, he drew his conclusions, true or false, from
the impassibility of her demeanour. Her answer was
ready&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How could they hang an innocent woman?"</p>

<p>"But they <i>do</i> hang hundreds, who say just what
you say," replied he. "What are you to make of that
riddle? Come, did you ever buy any poison?&mdash;please
leave out the rats."</p>

<p>"No; neither for rats nor servants," was the composed
reply.</p>

<p>"And you never gave the woman a dose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have given her medicine more than once."</p>

<p>"Oh, a capital thing to save life; but you know her
life was not saved. She died and was buried, and has
been taken up; and I suspect it was not your jalap that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
was found in the body. But what interest had you
in being so very kind to the woman who was to
bring shame on your family by bearing a child to
your son?"</p>

<p>"I never knew she was in that way; but though
I had known it, I could not have taken away her
life."</p>

<p>"Then, who gave her the poison?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"And cannot even suspect any one?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he said, as he started up and hurried
away; muttering to himself, as the jailer undid the
bolts, "Always the same!&mdash;the women are always
innocent; and yet we see them stretching ropes other
than clothes' ropes every now and then."</p>

<p>Defeated, but as little discomfited, as we might gather
from his pithy soliloquy, his next step was to double
up, as he termed it, the authorities, who, he knew,
would never have gone the length of apprehending the
woman without having got hold of evidence sufficient
to justify Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, a considerate
and prudent man, that the charge lay heavy
on the prisoner. He had no right of access, at this
stage, to the names of the intended witnesses; but to a
man of his activity it is no difficult matter to find these
out, from the natural garrulity of the people, and a
kind of self-importance in being a Crown testimony.
Then to find them out was next to drawing them out;
for it may be safely said for our writer that there was
no man, from the time of John Wilkes, who could
exercise a more winning persuasion. One by one he
ferreted them out, wheedled, threatened, adjured, but
found himself resisted in every attempt to break them
down or to turn them to him. At every stage of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
inquiry he saw the case for the prisoner assuming a
dark aspect&mdash;as dark, he so termed it, as the face of a
hanged culprit.</p>

<p>"The beagles have got a track. There are more foxes
in the cover than one; and shall it be said I, David M&mdash;&mdash;,
cannot beat out another as stimulating to the nose?"</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour after having made this observation
to himself, he was posting on horseback to the
farm of D&mdash;&mdash;, where he arrived in as short a time as
he generally took on his journeys.</p>

<p>"I am afraid to ask you for intelligence," said the
farmer, as he stood by the horse's side, and addressed
the writer, who kept his seat.</p>

<p>"Get me two and five-eighths of a glass of whisky
in a jug of milk, and I'll tell you then what I want. I
have no time to dismount."</p>

<p>The farmer complied.</p>

<p>"The case looks ugly," said the writer, as he handed
back the jug. "These witnesses would hang a calendared
saint of a hundred miracles. Are any tramps in
the habit of coming about you?"</p>

<p>"Too many."</p>

<p>"Do you know any of them?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely&mdash;not by name."</p>

<p>"Any women?&mdash;never mind the men," said the
writer impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes; there is one who used to come often; she
sold small things."</p>

<p>"Is that all you know of her? Has she no mark,
man? Is her nose long or short? no squint, lame
leg, or pock-pits?"</p>

<p>"She had usually a small cage, in which she kept a
couple of white mice."</p>

<p>"White mice!" ejaculated the writer; "never was
a better mark."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know her name?"</p>

<p>"No; nor do I think any of my present people do."</p>

<p>"When was she here last?"</p>

<p>"About a month ago."</p>

<p>"Anywhere near the time of the girl's death?"</p>

<p>"Ay, just about that time, or maybe a week before."</p>

<p>"And you can give me no trace of her?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, except that I think I saw her take
to the east, in the way to Arbroath. But I do not see
how she can be of any use."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to see that she can be of any
use," said the writer, laughing; "but I want you to
hear whereabout she is."</p>

<p>"I will try what I can," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"And let me know by some messenger who can ride
as fast as I can." Then adding, "Gilderoy was saved
by a <i>brown</i> mouse, which gnawed the string by which
the key of the jail door of Forfar hung on a nail,
whereby the key fell to the ground, and was pulled by
him through an opening at the bottom. Heard you
ever the story?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But it's true, nevertheless. What would you say
if a <i>white</i> mouse, or two of them, should save the life
of your wife?"</p>

<p>"I would say it was wonderful," replied the farmer,
with eyes a-goggled by amazement.</p>

<p>"And so would I," answered Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, as he put
the rowels into the side of his horse and began a hard
trot, which he would not slacken till he was at the
Cowgate port, and not even then, for he made his
way generally through the streets of the town with
equal rapidity, and always the safer that he was the
"fresher."</p>

<p>On arriving at his office he sat down, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
apparently any premeditation, unless what he had
indulged in during his trot, wrote off with his usual
rapidity four letters to the following effect:&mdash;"Dear
Sir,&mdash;As agent for Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, who now lies in our
jail on a charge of murder, I request you will endeavour
to find some trace of a woman who goes through
the country with a cage and two white mice. Grave
suspicions attach to her, as the person who administered
the poison, and I wish your energies to be employed
in aiding me to search her out." The letters
were directed to agents in Arbroath, Forfar, Kirriemuir,
and Montrose, and immediately committed to a clerk
to be taken to the post-office, with a good-natured
laugh on the lips of the writer&mdash;and, within the teeth,
the little monologue&mdash;"The wrinkled skin easily conceals
a scar."</p>

<p>From some source or another, probably the true one
may be guessed, an <i>uberrima fides</i> began to hang round
a report that a new feature had spread over the face
of Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;'s case; and that, in place of her being
the guilty person, the culprit was a tramp, with white
mice in a cage. Nor were the authorities long in being
startled by the report; but where that woman was no
one could tell, and a vague report was no foundation
for authoritative action. But if it was not for a Lord
Advocate to seek out or hunt after white mice, that
was no reason why the prisoner's agent should not
condescend to so very humble an office; and, accordingly,
two days after the despatch of the letters I have
mentioned, the same horse that carried the writer on
the former occasion, and knew so well the prick of his
rowels, was ready saddled at the door of the office.
The head of the agent was instantly drawn out of some
other deep well of legal truth, some score of directions
given to clerks, and he was off on the road to Glammis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
but not before some flash had shown him what he was
to do when he got there. The same rapid trot was
commenced, and continued, to the great diminution of
the sap of the animal, until the place he was destined
for loomed before him. He now commenced inquiries
upon inquiries. Every traveller was questioned, every
door got a touch of his whip, until at length he got a
trace, and he was again in full pursuit. I think it is
Suidas who says that these pretty little animals, called
white mice, are very amatory, and have a strong odour,
but this must be only to their mates. I doubt if even
the nostrils of a writer are equal to this perception,
whatever sense they may possess in the case of pigeons
with a pluckable covering. But, however this may be,
it was soon observable that our pursuer had at least
something in his eye. The spurs were active; and,
by and by, he drew up at a small road-side change-house,
into the kitchen of which he tumbled, without
a premonitory question, and there, before him, sat the
veritable mistress of these very white mice, spaeing
the fortunes of some laughing girls, who saw the illuminated
figures of their lovers in the future.<a name="FNanchor_1_" id="FNanchor_1_"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_" id="Footnote_1_"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> One version of the story says that Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; picked up the
tramp at Cammerton, in Fife; but I adhere to my authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p></div>

<p>"Can you read me <i>my</i> fortune?" he said, in his own
peculiar way.</p>

<p>"Na; I ken ye owre weel," was the quick reply, as
she turned a pair of keen, grey eyes on him.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll speak to me at any rate," he said. "I
have something to say to you."</p>

<p>And, going into the adjoining parlour, he called for
a half-mutchkin. He needed some himself, and he
knew the tramp was not an abstainer.</p>

<p>"Tell the woman to come ben," he said, as the man
placed the whisky on the table.</p>

<p>"What can you want, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, with that old,
never-mend vagabond?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps an uncle has left her five hundred pounds,"
said the writer with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Gude save us! the creature will go mad," said the
man, as he went out, not knowing whether his guest
was in humour or earnest.</p>

<p>But, whatever he said to the woman, there she was,
presently, white mice and all, seated alongside of the
writer, who could make a beggar or a baron at home
with him, with equal ease, and in an equally short
time.</p>

<p>"You're obliged to me, I think, if I can trust to a
pretty long memory," he said, handing her a glass of
the spirits.</p>

<p>"Ay; but it doesna need a lang memory to mind
gi'en me this," she replied, not wishing any other reason
for her obligation.</p>

<p>"And you've forgotten the pirn scrape?"</p>

<p>"The deil's in a lang memory; but I hinna," she
replied, with more confidence, for by this time the
whisky had disappeared in the accustomed bourne of
departed spirits.</p>

<p>"Weel, it's a bad business that at your auld freend's
at D&mdash;&mdash;," said he, getting into his Scotch, for familiarity.
"Hae ye heard?"</p>

<p>"Wha hasna heard? I kenned the lassie brawly;
but I didna like her&mdash;she was never gude to a puir
cratur like me."</p>

<p>"But they say ye ken mair than ither folk?" said
he.</p>

<p>"Maybe I do," replied the woman, getting proud of
the impeachment. "Hae we nae lugs and een, ay,
and stamachs, like ither folk?"</p>

<p>"And could ye do naething to save this puir woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the wife o' a gude buirdly man, wi' an open hand to
your kin, and the mither o' a family?"</p>

<p>"I care naething about her being the wife o' a man,
or the mither o' a family; but I ken what I ken."</p>

<p>"And sometimes what ye dinna ken, when you tell
the lasses o' their lovers ye never saw."</p>

<p>"The deil tak their louping hearts into his hand for
silly gawkies; if they werena a' red-wood about lads,
they wadna heed me a whistle. But though I might
try to get Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;'s head out o' the loop, I wadna
like to put my ain in."</p>

<p>"I'll tak gude care o' that," said the writer. "I got
ye out o' a scrape before."</p>

<p>"Weel than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And weel than," echoed he.</p>

<p>"And better than weel than; suppose I swore I did
it mysel'&mdash;and maybe I did; that's no your business&mdash;they
wadna hang a puir wretch like me for her ain
words, wad they, when there's nae proof I did it but
my ain tongue?"</p>

<p>"No likely," replied he; "and then a hunder gowden
guineas as a present, no as a bribe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want nae bribes&mdash;I gie value for my fortunes.
If it's wind, wind is the breath o' life; a present!"</p>

<p>"Would make your een jump," added he, finishing
his sentence.</p>

<p>"Jump! ay, loup! Whar are they?"</p>

<p>"You'll get the half when you come into the town,
and the other when Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;is safe. You will ca'
at my office on Wednesday; and, after that, I'll tak
care o' you. In the meantime, ye maun sell your
mice."</p>

<p>"Geordie Cameron offered me five shillings for them;
I'll gie them to him."</p>

<p>"No," replied the writer; "no to a <i>man</i>. Ken ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
nae woman-tramp will tak them, and show them about
as you do?"</p>

<p>"Ou ay; I'll gie them to Meg Davidson, wha's to
be here the night. But whaurfor no Geordie?"</p>

<p>"Never ye mind that, I ken the difference; and if
Meg doesna give you the five shillings, I will."</p>

<p>"Well, buy them yoursel'," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Done," said he; "there's five guineas for them, and
you can gie them to Meg as a present. Now, are ye firm?"</p>

<p>"Firm!" she cried, as she clutched the money, and
gave a shrill laugh, from a nerve that was never softened
by pity or penitence. "I think nae mair on't, man&mdash;sir,
I mean, for ye proved yoursel' a gentleman to me
afore&mdash;than I do now in spaeing twins to your wife at
her next doun-lying."</p>

<p>A rap on the table, from the bottom of the pewter
measure, brought in the landlord.</p>

<p>"Fill that again," said the writer.</p>

<p>And the man having re-entered with the pewter
measure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're to give this woman board and lodging for a
day or two, and I will pay you before I start."</p>

<p>"That will be oot o' the five hundred frae her uncle,"
said the man, laughing. "She's my lady noo; but
what will become o' the mice?"</p>

<p>"There's Meg Davidson passing the window e'en
noo," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Send her in," said the writer to the change-house
keeper.</p>

<p>The woman going under this name was immediately
introduced by the man, with a kind of mock formality;
for he could not get quit of the impression that his old
customer had really succeeded to the five hundred
pounds&mdash;a sum, in his estimation, sufficiently large to
insure respect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maggy," said the writer, "tak this chair, and here's
a dram. What think ye?"</p>

<p>"I dinna ken."</p>

<p>"Ye're to get the twa white mice and the cage for
naething, and this dram to boot."</p>

<p>Meg's face cleared up like a June sun come out in a
burst.</p>

<p>"Na," she said; "ye're joking."</p>

<p>"But it's upon a condition," rejoined he.</p>

<p>"Weel, what is't&mdash;that I'm to feed them weel, and
keep them clean?"</p>

<p>"You'll do that too," said he, laughing, "for they're
valuable creatures, and bonny; but you're to say
you've had them for a year."</p>

<p>"For twa, if you like," replied the woman; "a puir
fusionless lee that, and no worth sending a body to the
deil for."</p>

<p>"Here they are," said the tramp; "and you're to tak
care o' them. They've been my staff for mony a day,
and they're the only creatures on earth I care for and
like; for they never said to me, 'Get out, ye wretch,'
or banned me for a witch; but were aye sae happy wi'
their pickles o' barley, and maybe a knot o' sugar, when
I could get at a farmer's wife's bowl."</p>

<p>Even hags have pathetic moods. Meg was affected;
and the writer, having appreciated the virtue, whispered
in the ear of his <i>protegée</i>, "Seven o'clock on Wednesday
night," and left them to the remainder of the whisky.
At the door he settled with the man, and, mounting his
horse, which he had ordered a bottle of strong ale for,
in addition to his oats, he set off at his old trot.</p>

<p>"Now let the Crown blood-hounds catch Meg Davidson
and her mice," he said, as he pushed on.</p>

<p>The writer was, no doubt, bent eagerly for home,
but he seldom got to his intended destination, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
we have given one or two examples of an uninterrupted
course, without undergoing several stoppages, either
from the sudden calls of business, which lay in every
direction, or the seductions of conviviality, equally
ubiquitous; and on this occasion he was hailed from the
window of the inn by some ten-tumbler men of Forfar,
whose plan for draining the loch, by making toddy of
it, had not, to their discomfort, been realized, but who
made due retaliation by very clean drainings elsewhere.
The moment he heard the shout he understood the
meaning thereof, because he knew the house, the
locality, and the men; and Meg Davidson and her mice
were passed into the wallet-bag of time, till he should
give these revellers their satisfaction in a boon companion
who could see them under the table, and then
mount his horse, with a power of retention of his seat
unexampled in a county famous for revolutions of heads
as well as of bodies. Dismounting from his horse, he
got his dinner, a meal he had expected at Dundee; and,
in spite of the distance of fourteen miles which lay before
him, he despatched tumbler after tumbler without
being once tempted to the imprudence of letting out
his extraordinary hunt, but rather with the prudence
of sending, through his compotators, to the county town
the fact that a woman who perambulated the country
with white mice was really the murderer of the country
girl. This statement he was able to make, even at that
acme of his dithyrambics, when, as usual, he got
upon the head of the table to make his speech of the
evening. It was now eleven, and he had swallowed
eight tumblers, yet he was comparatively steady when
he mounted; and, though during the fourteen miles
he swung like a well-ballasted barque in a gale of wind,
he made sufficient headway to be home by half-past
twelve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, as ready and able as usual for the
work of the day, he was at his desk about eleven, and
when engaged with one client, while others were waiting
to be despatched in the way in which he alone
could discharge clients, he was waited on by a gentleman
connected with the Crown Office. Having been
yielded a preference, the official took his seat.</p>

<p>"I understand you are employed for Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;?"
he said. "We have thought it necessary, as disinterested
protectors of the lives of the king's subjects,
to apprehend this woman. I need not say that our
precognitions are our guarantee; but I have heard a
report which would seem to impugn our discretion, if
it do not shame our judgment, insomuch that, if it be
true, we have seized the wrong person. Do you know
anything of this woman with the white mice, who takes
upon herself the burden of a self-accusation? Of
course it is for you to help us to her as the salvation
of your client."</p>

<p>"Too evident that for a parade of candour," replied
Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;. "Her name is Margaret Davidson. Her
white companions will identify her. Her residence is
where you may chance to find her."</p>

<p>"Very vague, considering your interest," replied the
other. "Where did you find her?"</p>

<p>"Ask me first, my dear sir, whether I have found
her. Perhaps not. If it is my interest to search her
out, it is not less your duty to catch her. A vagrant
with white mice is a kenspeckle, and surely you can
have no difficulty in tracing her. I need scarcely add,
that when you do find her, you will substitute her for
my client, and make amends for the disgrace you have
brought upon an innocent woman and a respectable
family."</p>

<p>"I won't say that," replied the other, shaking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
head. "The evidence against Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is too heavy
to admit of our believing a vagrant, influenced by the
desire of, perhaps, a paid martyrdom, or the excitement
of a mania."</p>

<p>"Then, why ask me to help you to find her?"</p>

<p>"For our satisfaction as public officers."</p>

<p>"And to my detriment as a private agent."</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Yes; if I choose to make her a witness for the defence,
and leave the jury to judge of <i>paid</i> martyrdom,
or her real madness. Paid martyrdom!&mdash;paid by
whom?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily by you."</p>

<p>"But you want me to help you to be able to prove
the bribe out of her own mouth, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course we would examine her."</p>

<p>"Yes, and cook her; but you must catch her first.
Really, my dear sir, a very useful recipe in cuisine;
and, hark ye, you can put the mice in the pan also.
But, really, I am not bound, and cannot in justice be
expected to do more. I have given you her name;
and when had a culprit so peculiar and striking a
designation as being the proprietor of a peripatetic
menagerie?"</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>ridiculus mus</i>! But are you not the labouring
mountain yourself, and do you not wish me to become
the midwife?"</p>

<p>"I perceive I can make nothing of you," at length
said the gentleman. "You either don't want to save
your client, or the means you trust to cannot stand the
test."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" roared the writer; "must I
tell you again that I have given you her name and
occupation? Even a cat, with nose-instinct put awry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by the colour of the white race of victims, would smell
her out."</p>

<p>Bowing the official to the door with these words, he
was presently in some other ravelled web, which he
disentangled with equal success and apparent ease; but,
following him in his great scheme, we find him in the
afternoon posting again to the farm. He found the
farmer in the same collapse of hope, sitting in the arm-chair
so long pressed by his wife, with his chin upon
his breast, and his eyes dim and dead. The evidence
had got piece by piece to his ear, paralyzing more and
more the tissues of his brain; and hope had assumed
the character of an impossibility in the moral world of
God's government.</p>

<p>"You must cheer up," said the writer. "Come,
some milk and whisky. Move about; I have got good
news for you, but cannot trust you."</p>

<p>The head of the man was raised up, and a slight
beam was, as it were, struck from his eye by the jerk
of a sudden impulse. His step, as he moved to gratify
the agent, seemed to have acquired even a spring.</p>

<p>"Why are you here," he said, as he brought the indispensable
jug, with something even more than the
five-eighths of the spiritual element added to the two
glasses, "if you cannot tell me the grounds of my hope?
I could not comprehend what you meant about the
woman and the white mice."</p>

<p>"Nor do I want you to understand it; it is enough
if I do," replied Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, as he put the jug to his
mouth; "but this I want you to understand, in the
first place, that I want an order for fifty pounds from
you."</p>

<p>The farmer was too happy to write an order for any
amount within the limits of his last farthing, and getting
pen and ink, he wrote the cheque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you couldn't tell me the name of the woman
with the mice; but I can tell you," he continued.
"It is Margaret Davidson; and, hark ye&mdash;come near
me, man&mdash;if you are called upon by any one with the
appearance of a sheriff's beagle, or whatever he may be
like, for the name of that woman, say it is Margaret
Davidson, and that they will find her between Lerwick
and Berwick. Do you comprehend?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"And, moreover, you are to tell every living soul
within ear-shot, servants or strangers, that it was that
very woman who gave the dose to the lass, and that the
woman herself does not deny it."</p>

<p>"Gude Lord! but is all this true, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Is it true your wife did it, then, you d&mdash;&mdash;d idiot?"
cried the writer, using thus one of his most familiar
terms, but with perfect good-nature. "Don't you in
your heart&mdash;or hope, at any rate&mdash;think the Lord
Advocate a liar? and has his lordship a better right to
lie than I or Meg Davidson? Isn't the world a great
leavened lump of lies from the Cape of Good Hope to
the Cape of Wrath? And you want your wife hanged,
because the nose of truth is out of joint a bit! Ay, what
though it were cut off altogether, if you get your wife's
back without being coloured blue by the hangman?
But, I tell you, it's not a lie: the woman with the
white mice says it of her own accord."</p>

<p>"Wonderful! the woman with the white mice!"</p>

<p>"The woman with the white mice!" echoed the
writer.</p>

<p>And, getting again upon his legs, he hurried out,
throwing back his injunctions upon S&mdash;&mdash; to obey his
instructions. In a few minutes more he was again
upon the road, leaving the clatter of his horse's hoofs
to mingle with the confused thoughts of his mystified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
client. Arrived at the High Street, where, as used to
be said of him, he could not be ten minutes without
having seized some five or six persons by the breast of
the coat, and put as many questions on various matters
of business, just as the thought struck him on the instant,
he pounced upon one, no other than the confidential
clerk of the fiscal.</p>

<p>"I say, man," seizing and holding him in the usual
way, "have you catched the woman yet?"</p>

<p>"What woman?" replied the clerk.</p>

<p>"The woman with the white mice."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the young man, "we have no faith in
that quarter&mdash;a mere get-up; but we're looking about
for her, notwithstanding."</p>

<p>"Well, tell your master that Meg Davidson was last
seen on the Muir of Rannoch, and that the Highlanders
in that outlandish quarter, having never seen white mice
before, are in a state of perfect amazement."</p>

<p>A bolt at some other person left the clerk probably
in as great amazement as the Highlanders; but our
man of the law did not stop to see the extent of it.
All his avocations, however, did not prevent the coming
round of that seven o'clock on Wednesday evening,
which he had appointed as the hour of meeting with the
woman on whom his hopes of saving his client almost
altogether rested. He was at his desk at the hour, and
the woman, no doubt eager for the phenomenon of the
"louping ee," was as true as the time itself. The writer
locked the door of his office, and drawing her as near
him as possible, inquired first whether any knew she
was in town.</p>

<p>"Deil are," she replied; "naebody cares for me ony
mair than I were an auld glandered spavin, ready for
the knackers."</p>

<p>"And you've been remembering a' ye are to say?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the woman did not answer this question immediately.
She had been, for some days, busy in the
repository of her memory&mdash;a crazy box of shattered
spunk-wood, through the crevices of which came the
lurid lights sent from another box, called the imagination,
and such was the close intimacy, or rather mixture,
of the revelations of these two magic centres, that they
could not be distinguished from one another; but the
habit of fortune-telling had so quickened the light of
the one, as to make it predominate over, and almost
extinguish that of the other, so that she was at a loss
to get a stray glimmer of the memory, to make her
ready, on the instant, for the answer.</p>

<p>"Remembering! Ay," she said, "there's no muckle
to remember. The lass was under the burden of shame,
and couldna bear it: she wanted some doctor's trash to
tak that burden aff her, if it should carry her life alang
wi' 't. I got the stuff, and the woman dee'd."</p>

<p>All which was carefully written down&mdash;but the writer
had his own way of doing his work. He would have day
and date, the place where the doctor's trash was bought,
the price thereof, the manner of administering the same,
and many other particulars, every one of which was so
carefully recorded, that the whole, no doubt, looked like
a veritable precognition of facts, got from the said box
called the memory, as if it had been that not one tint of
light, from the conterminous chamber, had mixed with
the pure spirit of truth.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "regaining his English, when his
purpose was served, "you'll stand firm to this, in the
face of judge, jury, justice, and all her angels?"</p>

<p>"Never ye fear."</p>

<p>"Then, you will go with me to a private lodging,
where I wish you to remain, seen by as few as you can.
You're a widow; your name is Mrs. Anderson; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
husband was drowned in the Maelstrom. Get weeds,
a veil, and look respectable."</p>

<p>"A' save the last, for that's impossible."</p>

<p>"Try; and, as you will need to pay for your board
and lodgings, and your dress, here's the sum I promised
ye; the other half when Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; is saved."</p>

<p>"A' right; and did I no say my ee would loup?&mdash;but
'ae gude turn deserves anither,' as the deil said to
the loon o' Culloden, when he hauled him doun, screaming,
to a place ye maybe ken o', and whaur I hae nae
wish to be."</p>

<p>"Where is Meg Davidson?" he then asked.</p>

<p>"Oh ay!" she replied, "that puts me in mind o' a
man wha met me on the road, and asked me if I was
the woman wi' the twa white mice? I tauld him she
was awa east to Montrose, and sae it is."</p>

<p>"Not a cheep of the sale," added he.</p>

<p>"Na, na, nor o' ony thing else, but just Mrs. Anderson,
the widow, whase man was drouned in the Maelstream."</p>

<p>And, having thus finished, the writer led the woman
to her place of safety, there to lie <i>in retentis</i> till the
court-day.</p>

<p>That eventful day came round. In the meantime,
the prosecution never got access to the real white
mouse tramp, and whatever they got out of Meg
Davidson, satisfied them that she knew nothing of the
murder. Large sums were given to secure the services
of Jeffrey, then in the full blaze of his power, and
Cockburn, so useful in examinations. The Lord Advocate
led his proof, which was no darker than our
writer had ascertained it to be, when he found himself
driven to his clever expedient. The proof for the
defence began; and, after some other witnesses were
examined, the name of the woman with the white mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was called by the macer; and here occurred a circumstance,
at the time known to very few. Cockburn turned
round to our country agent, who was sitting behind him,
and said, in a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"M&mdash;&mdash;, if the angel Gabriel were at this moment
to come down and blow a trumpet, and tell me that
what this woman is going to swear to is truth, I would
not believe her."</p>

<p>Nor is there any doubt to be entertained that the
woman's testimony took the court and the audience by
surprise. The judges looked at each other, and the
jury were perplexed. There was only one thing that
produced any solicitude in our writer. He feared the
Lord Advocate would lay hands upon her, as either a
murderer or a perjurer, the moment she left the witness-box.
At that instant was he prepared. Quietly
slipping out, he got hold of the woman, led her to the
outer door, through a crowd, called to the door-keeper,
who stood sentry, to open for the purpose of letting in
a fresh witness of great importance to the accused; and
having succeeded, as he seldom failed, he got the woman
outside. A cab was in readiness&mdash;no time lost&mdash;the
woman was pushed in, followed by her guardian, and
in a short time was safely disposed of. Meanwhile,
the Crown authorities had been preparing their warrant,
and the woman was only saved from their mercies
by a very few minutes.</p>

<p>It is well known, as I have already mentioned, that
Jeffrey's speech for Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; was the greatest of all
modern orations, yet it was delivered under peculiar
circumstances. When he rose and began, he seemed
languid and unwell. The wonted sparkle was not seen
in his eye, the usually compressed lip was loose and
flaccid, and his words, though all his beginnings were
generally marked with a subdued tone, came with diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>culty.
Cockburn looked at him inquiringly, anxious
and troubled. There was something wrong, and those
interested in the defence augured ominously. All of
a sudden the little man stopped, fixed his eye on one
of the walls of the court-room, and cried out, "Shut
that window." Through that opening a cold wind had
been blowing-upon and chilling a body which, though
firm and compact, was thin, wiry, and delicately toned
to the refined requirements of the spirit that animated
and moved it with a grace peculiarly his own. The
chill, in consonance with well-known pathological laws,
produced first depression, and then a feverish reaction,
which latter was even morbidly favourable to the development
of his powers. He began to revive; the
blood, pulsing with more than natural activity, warmed
still more at the call of his enthusiasm. He analyzed
every part of the cause, tore up the characters of the
prosecutor's witnesses, held up microscopic flaws, and
passed them through the lens of his ingenious exaggeration,
till they appeared serious in the eyes of the
jury. Then how touching, if not noble, was the conduct
of that strange witness for the defence&mdash;who, a wretched
criminal herself, would yet, under a secret power, so far
expiate her guilt by offering herself as a sacrifice for
innocence! Beyond all was the pathos of his peroration,
where he brought home the case to the jury, as loving
husbands of loving wives, and tender fathers of beloved
children. A woman sat there before them&mdash;a wife and
a mother. She had undergone an ordeal not much less
trying than death itself, and even then she was trembling
under the agony of suspense, extended beyond mortal
powers of endurance&mdash;to be terminated by the breath
of their mouths, either for life and a restoration to a
previously happy family, or for a death on a gallows,
with all its ignominy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>That speech, which nearly cost Jeffrey his life, saved
that of another. The jury found the libel not proven;
Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; was free; Jeffrey was made more famous;
but no one ever heard more of the woman with the white
mice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GLEANINGS_OF_THE_COVENANT" id="GLEANINGS_OF_THE_COVENANT"></a>GLEANINGS OF THE COVENANT.</h2>

<h3>THE EARLY DAYS OF A FRIEND OF THE COVENANT.</h3>


<p>I was born in the upper district and amidst the mountains
of Dumfriesshire. My father, who died ere I had
attained my second birthday, had seen better times; but,
having engaged in mercantile speculations, had been
overreached or unfortunate, or both, and during the
latter years of his life had carried a gun, kept an
amazing pointer bitch (of which my mother used to
discourse largely), and had ultimately married in a fit
of despondency. My mother, to whom he had long
been affianced, was nearly connected with the Lairds
of Clauchry, of which relationship she was vain; and
in all her trials, of which she had no ordinary share,
she still retained somewhat of the feelings, as well as
the appearance of a gentlewoman. I remember, for
example, a pair of high-heeled red Morocco shoes,
overhung by the ample drapery of a quilted silk gown,
in which habiliments she appeared on great occasions.
Soon after my father's decease, my mother found it
convenient and advisable to remove from the neighbourhood
of the Clauchry to a cottage, or cottier as it
was called, on her brother's farm, in the upper division
of the parish of Closeburn.</p>

<p>Few situations could be better fitted for the purpose
of a quiet and sequestered retreat. The scene is now
as vividly before me as it was on that day when I last
saw it, and felt that, in all probability, I viewed it for
the last time. A snug kailyard, surrounded by a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>grown
bushy hedge of bourtree, saugh, and thorn, lay
along the border of a small mountain stream, and hard
by a thatched cottage, with a peat-stack at the one end
and a small byre at the other. All this was nestled as
it were in the bosom of mountains, which, to the north
and the east in particular, presented a defence against
all winds, and an outline of bold grandeur exceedingly
impressive. The south and the west were more open;
consequently the mid-day and afternoon sun reposed,
with delightful and unobstructed radiance, on the green
border of the stream, and the flowery foliage of the brae.
And when the evening was calm, and the season suitable,
the blue smoke winded upwards, and the birds
sang delightfully amidst hazel, and oak, and birch, with
a profusion of which the eastern bank was covered. It
was here that I spent my early days; and it was in this
scene of mountain solitude, with no immediate associate
but my mother, and for a few years of my existence
my grandmother, that my "feelings and fortunes were
formed and shaped out."</p>

<p>To be brought up amidst mountain scenery, apart
and afar from the busy or polluted haunts of man; to
place one's little bare foot, with its first movement, on
the greensward, the brown heath, or in the pure stream;
to live in the retired glen, a perceptible part of all that
lives and enjoys; to feel the bracing air of freedom in
every breeze; to be possessed of elbow room from ridge
to summit, from bank to brae,&mdash;this is, indeed, the most
delightful of all infant schools, and, above all, prepares
the young and infant mind for enlarged conception and
resolute daring.</p>

<p>
"To sit on rocks; to muse o'er flood and fell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,</span><br />
Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mortal foot hath ne'er or seldom been;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><br />
To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the wild flock that never needs a fold;</span><br />
Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is not solitude&mdash;'tis but to hold</span><br />
Converse with Nature's God, and see his works unrolled."<br />
</p>

<p>Here, indeed, are the things that own not the dominion
of man! The everlasting hills, in their outlines of rock
and heath; the floods that leap in freedom, or rush in
defiance from steep to steep, from gullet to pool, and
from pool to plain; the very tempest that overpowers;
and heaven, through which the fowls of air sail with
supreme and unchallenged dominion,&mdash;all these inspire
the young heart with independence and self-reliance.
True it is that the child, and even the boy, reflects not
at all on the advantages of his situation; and this is the
very reason that his whole imagination and heart are
under their influence. He that is ever arresting and
analyzing the current of his thoughts, will seldom think
correctly; and he who examines with a microscopic eye
the sources of beauty and sublimity, will seldom feel
the full force and sway of such impressions. Early and
lasting friendships are the fruit of accident, rather than
of calculation&mdash;of feeling, rather than of reflection; and
the circumstances of scenery and habit, which modify the
child, and give a bent, a bias, and a character to the
after-life, pass all unestimated in regard to such tendency
at the time. The bulrush is not less unconscious
of the marsh which modifies its growth, or the wallflower
of the decay to which it clings, and by which
alone its nature and growth would be most advantageously
marked and perfected, than is the mountain child
of that moral as well as physical development, which
such peculiar circumstances are calculated to effect. If,
through all the vicissitudes and trials of my past life, I
have ever retained a spirit of independence, a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which has not, as the sequel (which I may yet give)
will evince, proved at all times advantageous to my
worldly advancement&mdash;if such has been the case, I owe
it, in a great measure, to the impression which the home
of my youth was calculated to make.</p>

<p>My mother had originally received a better education
than in those days was customary with individuals of
her class; and, in addition to this advantage, she had
long acted as housekeeper to an unmarried brother, the
minister of a parish in Galloway. In this situation, she
had access to a large and well-chosen library; and at
leisure intervals had improved the opportunity thus
presented. She was quite familiar with Young, and
Pope, and Dryden, as well as with Tate's translation of
Ovid's Epistles. These latter, in particular, she used to
repeat to me during the winter evenings, with a tone of
plaintiveness which I felt at the time, and the impression
of which can never be obliterated. From these early
associations and impressions I am enabled to deduce a
taste for poetry, which, while it has served to beguile
many an otherwise unsupportable sorrow, has largely
contributed to the actual enjoyments of life. There
are, indeed, moments of sadness and of joy, to which
poetry can bring neither alleviation nor zest; but
these, when compared with the more softening shadings,
are but rare; and when the intensity of grief or
of delight has yielded, or is in the act of yielding, to
time or reflection, it is then, in the gloaming or the
twilight, as darkness passes into light, or light into
darkness, that the soothing and softening notes of poesy
come over the soul like the blessed south.</p>

<p>In religion, or rather in politics&mdash;in as far, at least,
as they are interwoven with and inseparable from the
Presbyterian faith&mdash;my mother was a staunch Covenanter.
Nor was it at all surprising that one whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
forefathers had suffered so severely in defence of the
Covenant, and in opposition to oppression, should
imbibe their sentiments.  Her maternal grandfather
had suffered at the Gallowlee; and her grandmother,
who refused to give information to Clavers respecting
the retreat of her husband, had her new-born babe
plucked from her breast, dashed upon the floor, and
the very bed, from which, to rescue her babe, she had
sprung, pierced and perforated in a thousand places by
the swords of the ruffians. Whilst this tragedy was
enacting within doors, and in what, in these simple
times, was denominated the <i>chaumer</i>, her eldest son, a
boy of about twelve years of age, was arrested, and
because he would not, or in all probability could not,
disclose his father's retreat, he was blindfolded, tied to
a tree, and taught to expect that every ball which he
heard whizzing past his ear was aimed at his head.
The boy was left bound; and, upon his being released
by a menial, it was discovered that his reason had fled&mdash;and
for ever! He died a few years afterwards, being
known in the neighbourhood by the name of the Martyred
Innocent! I have often looked at the bloody
stone (for such stains are well known to be like those
upon Lady Macbeth's hand, indelible,) where fell, after
being perforated by a brace of bullets, Daniel M'Michael,
a faithful witness to the truth, whose tomb, with its
primitive and expressive inscription, is still to be seen
in the churchyard of Durisdeer.  Grierson of Lag made
a conspicuous figure in the parish of Closeburn in particular;
nor did my mother neglect to point out to me
the ruined tower and the waste domain around it, which
bespoke, according to her creed, the curse of God upon
the seed of the persecutor.  His elegy&mdash;somewhat
lengthy and dull&mdash;I could once repeat. I can now
only recall the striking lines where the Devil is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>troduced
as lamenting over the death of his faithful
and unflinching ally:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"What fatal news is this I hear?&mdash;<br />
On earth who shall my standard bear?&mdash;<br />
For Lag, who was my champion brave,<br />
Is dead, and now laid in his grave.<br />
<br />
"The want of him is a great grief&mdash;<br />
He was my manager-in-chief,<br />
Who sought my kingdom to improve;<br />
And to my laws he had great love," etc.<br />
</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And so on, through at least two hundred lines, composing
a pamphlet, hawked about, in my younger days,
in every huckster's basket, and sold in thousands to
the peasantry of Dumfriesshire and Galloway, at the
price of one penny. Whilst, however, the storm of evil
passions raged with such fury in what was termed the
western districts in particular, the poor, shelterless, and
persecuted Covenanter was not altogether destitute of
help or comfort. According to his own apprehension,
at least, his Maker was on his side; his prayers, offered
up on the mountain and in the cave, were heard and
answered; and a watchful Providence often interfered,
miraculously, both to punish his oppressors, and warn
him against the approach of danger. In evidence of
this, my mother was wont, amongst many others, to
quote the following instances, respecting which she herself
entertained no doubt whatever&mdash;instances which,
having never before been committed to paper, have at
least the recommendation of novelty in their favour.</p>

<p>One of the chief rendezvous of the Covenant was
Auchincairn, in the eastern district of Closeburn. To
this friendly, but, on that account, suspected roof, did
the poor wanderer of the mist, the glen, and the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tain
repair, at dead of night, to obtain what was barely
necessary for the support of nature. Grierson of Lag
was not ignorant of the fact, and accordingly, by a
sudden movement, was often found surrounding the
steading with men and horses before daybreak; yet,
prompt and well arranged as his measures were, they
were never successful. The objects of his search
uniformly escaped before the search was made. And
this singular good fortune was owing, according to my
authority, to the following circumstance. On the night
previous to such an unwelcome visit, a little bird, of a
peculiar feather and note, such as are not to be found
in this country, came, and perching upon the topmost
branch of the old ash tree in the corner of the garden,
poured forth its notes of friendly intimation. To these
the poor skulking friend of the Covenant listened, by
these he was warned, lifted his eyes and his feet to the
mountain, and was safe.</p>

<p>The curate of Closeburn was eminently active in
distressing his flock. He was one of those Aberdeen
divines whom the wisdom of the Glasgow council had
placed in the three hundred pulpits vacated in consequence
of a drunken and absurd decree. As his church
was deserted, he had had recourse to compulsory measures
to enforce attendance, and had actually dragged
servants and children, in carts and hurdles, to hear his
spiritual and edifying addresses; whilst, on the other
hand, his spies and emissaries were busied in giving
information against such masters and parents as fled
from his grasp, or resisted it. He had even gone so
far, under the countenance and sanction of the infamous
Lauderdale, as to forbid Christian burial in every
case where there was no attendance on his ministry.
Such was the character, and such the conduct of the
man against whom the prayers of a private meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the friends of Presbytery were earnestly directed on
the following occasion. The eldest son of the guidman
of Auchincairn had paid the debt of nature, and behooved
to be buried with his fathers in the churchyard of the
parish. To this, from the well-known character both
of curate and father, it was anticipated that resistance
would be made. Against this resistance, however,
measures were taken of a somewhat decided character.
The body was to be borne to the churchyard by men
in arms, whilst a part of the attendants were to remain
at home, for the purpose of addressing their Maker in
united prayer and supplication. Thus, doubly armed
and prepared, the funeral advanced towards the church
and manse. Meanwhile the prayer and supplication
were warm, and almost expostulatory, that <i>His</i> arm
might be stretched forth in behalf of His own covenanted
servants. A poor idiot, who had not been
judged a proper person to join in this service, was
heard to approach, and, after listening with great
seeming attention to the strain of the petitions which
were made, he, at length, unable to constrain himself
any longer, was heard to exclaim, "Haud at him, sirs,
haud at him&mdash;he's just at the pit brow!" Surprising
as it may appear, and incredulous as some may be,
there is sufficient evidence to prove that, just about
the time when this prediction was uttered, the curate
of Closeburn, whilst endeavouring to head and hurry
on a party of the military, suddenly dropped down and
expired.</p>

<p>Is it, then, matter of surprise that with my mother's
milk I imbibed a strong aversion to all manner of
oppression, and that, in the broadest and best sense of
the word, I became "a Whig?" To the mountain,
then, and the flood, I owe my spirit of independence&mdash;that
shelly-coat covering against which many arrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
have been directed; to my mother, and her Cameronian
and political bias, I owe my detestation of oppression&mdash;in
other words, my political creed&mdash;together with my
poetical leanings. But to my venerated grandmother,
in particular, I am indebted for my early acquaintance
with the whole history and economy of the spiritual
kingdoms, divided as they are into bogle, ghost, and
fairy-land.</p>

<p>I shall probably be regarded as an enthusiast whose
feelings no future evidence can reclaim from early impressions,
when I express my regret that the dreams
of my infancy and boyhood have fled&mdash;those dreams of
dark and bright agency, which shall probably never
again return, to agitate and interest&mdash;those dreams
which charmed me in the midst of a spiritual world,
and taught me to consider mere matter as only the
visible and tangible instrument through which spirit
was constantly acting&mdash;those dreams which appear as
the shadow and reflection of sacred intimation, and
which serve to guard the young heart, in particular,
from the cold and revolting tenets of materialism.
From the malevolence of him who walks and who
works in darkness&mdash;who goes about like a roaring lion
(but, in our climate and country, more frequently like
a bull-dog, or a nondescript bogle), seeking whom he
may terrify&mdash;I was taught to fly into the protecting
arms of the omnipotent Jehovah; that no class of beings
could break loose upon another without His high permission;
that the Evil One, under whatever disguise
or shape he might appear, was still restrained and
over-mastered by the Source of all good and of all
safety; whilst with the green-coated fairy, the laborious
brownie, and the nocturnal hearth-bairn, I almost
desired to live upon more intimate and friendly terms!</p>

<p>How poor, comparatively speaking, are the incidents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
how uninteresting is the machinery, of a modern fictitious
narrative!&mdash;sudden and unlooked-for reappearances
of those who were thought to be dead, discoveries
of substituted births, with various chances and misnomers&mdash;"antres
vast, and deserts wild!" One good,
tall, stalking ghost, with its compressed lips and pointed
fingers, with its glazed eye and measured step, is worth
them all! Oh for a real "<i>white lady</i>" under the
twilight of the year seventeen hundred and forty!
When the elegant Greek or warlike Roman walked
abroad or dined at home, he was surrounded by all the
influences of an interesting and captivating mythology&mdash;by
nymphs of the oak, of the mountain, and of the
spring&mdash;by the Lares and Penates of his fireside and
gateway&mdash;by the genius, the Ceres and the Bacchus of
his banquet.  When our forefathers contended for religious
and civil liberty on the mountain&mdash;when they
prayed for it in the glen, and in the silent darkness of
the damp and cheerless cave&mdash;they were surrounded,
not by material images, but by popular conceptions.
The tempter was still in the wilderness, with his suggestions
and his promises; and there, too, was the good
angel, to warn and to comfort, to strengthen and to
cheer. The very fowls of heaven bore on their wing
and in their note a message of warning or a voice of
comforting; and when the sound of psalms commingled
with the swelling rush of the cascade, there were often
heard, as it were, the harping of angels, the commingling
of heavenly with earthly melody. All this was
elevating and comforting precisely in proportion to the
belief by which it was supported; and it may fairly be
questioned whether such men as Peden and Cameron
would have maintained the struggle with so much nerve
and resolution if the sun of their faith had not been
surrounded by a halo&mdash;if the noonday of the gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
had not shaded away imperceptibly into the twilight of
superstition. In fact, superstition, in its softer and
milder modifications, seems to form a kind of barrier
or fence around the "sacred territory;" and it seldom
if ever fails to happen that, when the outworks are
driven in, the citadel is in danger; when the good old
woman has been completely disabused of her harmless
fancies, she may then aspire to the faith and the
religious comforts of the philosophy of Volney.</p>

<p>In confirmation of these observations, I may adduce
the belief and life of my nearest relatives. To them,
amidst all their superstitious impressions, religion,
pure and undefiled, was still the main hold&mdash;the sheet
anchor, stayed and steadied by which they were enabled
to bear up amidst the turmoils and tempests of life.
To an intimate acquaintance with, and a frequent reading
of the sacred volume, was added, under our humble
roof, family prayer both morning and evening&mdash;an
exercise which was performed by mother and daughter
alternately, and in a manner which, had I not actually
thought them inspired, would have surprised me. Those
who are unacquainted with the ancient Doric of our
devotional and intelligent peasantry, and with that
musical accentuation or chant of which it is not only
susceptible, but upon which it is in a manner constructed,
can have but a very imperfect notion of family
prayer, performed in the manner I refer to. Many
there are who smile at that familiarity of address and
homeliness of expression which are generally made use
of; but under that homely address there lie a sincerity
and earnestness, a soothing, arousing, and penetrating
eloquence, which neither in public nor in private prayer
have ever been excelled. Again and again I have felt
my breast swell and my eyes fill whilst the prayer of a
parent was presented at a throne of grace in words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to the following purpose:&mdash;"Help him, good Lord!"
(speaking in reference to myself), "oh help my puir,
faitherless bairn in the day of frowardness and in the
hour of folly&mdash;in the season of forgetfulness and of
unforeseen danger&mdash;in trial and in difficulty&mdash;in life
and in death. Good Lord, for his sainted father's sake
(who is now, we trust, with Thee), for my puir sake,
who am unworthy to ask the favour, and, far aboon
and above a', for thine own well-beloved Son's sake,
do <i>Thou</i> be pleased to keep, counsel, and support my
puir helpless wean, when mine eyes shall be closed, and
my lips shall be shut, and my hands shall have ceased
to labour. Thou that didst visit Hagar and her child
in the thirsty wilderness&mdash;Thou that didst bring thy
servant Joseph from the pit and the miry clay&mdash;Thou
that didst carry thy beloved people Israel through a
barren desert to a promised and fruitful land&mdash;do Thou
be a husband and a father to me and mine; and oh
forbid that, in adversity or in prosperity, by day or by
night, in the solitude or in the city, we should ever
forget Thee!"</p>

<p>In an age when, amongst our peasantry in particular,
family prayer is so extensively and mournfully neglected&mdash;when
the farmer, the manufacturer, the mechanic,
not to mention the more elevated orders, have ceased to
obey the injunction laid upon all Presbyterian parents
in baptism&mdash;it is refreshing to look back to the time
when the taking of the book, as it was termed, returned
as regularly as the rising and the setting of the sun&mdash;when
the whole household convened together, morning
and evening, to worship the God of their fathers. In
public worship, as well as in private prayer, there is
much of comforting and spiritual support. It is pleasing,
as well as useful, to unite voice with voice, and
heart with heart; it is consolatory, as well as comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ing,
to retire from the world to commune with one's
heart and be still; but it is not the less delightful and
refreshing to unite in family prayer the charities and
sympathies of life&mdash;to come to the throne of mercy and
of pardon in the attitude and capacity of parent and
child, brother and sister, husband and wife, master and
servant, and to express, in the common confession, petition,
and thanksgiving, our united feelings of sinfulness,
resignation, and gratitude.</p>

<p>Milton paints beautifully the first impressions which
death made upon Eve; and sure I am that, though
conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, I remember
the time when I was entirely ignorant of death.
I had indeed been informed that I had a father; but as
to any change which had been effected upon him by
death, I was as ignorant as if I had been embowered
from my birth amidst the evergreens of paradise.
Everything around me appeared to be permanent and
undying, almost unchanging.  The sun set only to
rise again; the moon waned, and then reappeared, reassured
in strength and repaired in form; the stars, in
their courses, walked steadily and uniformly over my
head; the flowers faded and nourished; the birds exchanged
silence for song; the domestic animals were
all my acquaintances from the dawn of memory. To
me, and to those associated with me, similar events
happened: we ate, drank, went to sleep, and arose
again, with the utmost regularity. I had, indeed,
heard of death as of some inconceivable evil; but, in
my imagination, its operation had no figure. I had
not even seen a dog die; for my father's favourite
Gipsy lived for nine years after his death&mdash;a cherished
and respected pensioner. At last, however, the period
arrived when the spell was to be broken for ever&mdash;when
I was to be let into the secret of the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
corruption, and made acquainted with the change which
death induces upon the human countenance.</p>

<p>My grandmother had attained a very advanced old
age, yet was she straight in person, and perfect in all
her mental faculties. Her countenance, which I still
see distinctly, was expressive of good-will; and the
wrinkles on her brow served to add a kind of intellectual
activity to a face naturally soft, and even comely.
She had told me so many stories, given me so many
good advices, initiated me so carefully in the elements
of all learning, "the small and capital letters," and,
lastly, had so frequently interposed betwixt me and
parental chastisement, that I bore her as much good-will
and kindly feeling as a boy of seven years could
reasonably be expected to exhibit. True it is, and of
verity, that this kindly feeling was not incompatible
with many acts of annoyance, for which I now take
shame and express regret; but these acts were anything
but malevolent, being committed under the view
of self-indulgence merely. It was, therefore, with
infinite concern that I received the intelligence from
my mother that grannie was, in all probability, on the
point of leaving us, and for ever.</p>

<p>"Leaving us, and for ever," sounded in my ears like
a dream of the night, in which I had seen the stream
which passed our door swell suddenly into a torrent,
and the torrent into a flood, carrying me, and everything
around me, away in its waters. I felt unassured
in regard to my condition, and was half disposed to
believe that I was still asleep and imagining horrors!
But when my mother told me that the disease which
had for days confined my grandmother to bed would
end in death&mdash;in other words, would place her alongside
of my father's grave in the churchyard of Closeburn&mdash;I
felt that I was not asleep, but awake to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
dreadful reality, which was about to overtake us. From
this period till within a few hours of her dissolution, I
kept cautiously and carefully aloof from all intercourse
with my grandmother&mdash;I felt, as it were, unwilling to
renew an intercourse which was so certainly, and so
soon, and so permanently to be interrupted; so I betook
myself to the hills, and to the pursuit of all manner of
bees and butterflies. I would not, in fact, rest; and
as I lay extended on my back amidst the heath, and
marked the soft and filmy cloud swimming slowly along,
"making the blue one white," I thought of her who
was dying, and of some holy and happy residence far
beyond the utmost elevation of cloud, or sun, or sky.
Again and again I have risen from such reveries to
plunge myself headlong into the pool, or pursue with
increased activity the winged insects which buzzed and
flitted around me. Strange indeed are the impressions
made upon our yet unstamped, unbiassed nature; and
could we in every instance recall them, their history
would be so unlike our more recent experience, as to
make us suspect our personal identity. I do not remember
any more recent feeling which corresponded
in character and degree with this, whose wayward and
strange workings I am endeavouring to describe; and
yet in this case, and in all its accompaniments, I have
as perfect a recollection of facts, and reverence of feeling,
as if I were yet the child of seven, visited for the
first time with tidings of death.</p>

<p>My grandmother's end drew nigh, and I was commanded,
or rather dragged, to her bedside. There I
still see her lying, calm, but emaciated, in remarkably
white sheets, and a head dress which seemed to speak
of some approaching change. It was drawn closely
over her brow, and covered the chin up to her lips.
Nature had manifestly given up the contest; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
although her voice was scarcely audible, her reason
evidently continued unclouded and entire. She spoke
to me slowly and solemnly of religion, obedience to my
mother, and being obliging to every one; laid, by my
mother's assistance, her hand upon my head, as I kneeled
at her bedside, and in a few instants had ceased to
breathe. I lifted up my head at my mother's bidding,
and beheld a corpse. What I saw or what I felt, I
can never express in words. I can only recollect that
I sprang immediately, horror-struck, to my feet, rushed
out at the door, made for the closest and thickest part
of the brushwood of the adjoining brae, and, casting
myself headlong into the midst of it, burst into tears.
I wept, nay, roared aloud; my grief and astonishment
were intense whilst they lasted, but they did not last
long; for when I returned home about dusk, I found
a small table spread over with a clean cloth, upon which
was placed a bottle with spirits, a loaf of bread, and
cheese cut into pretty large pieces. Around this table
sat my mother, with two old women from the nearest
hamlet. They were talking in a low but in a wonderfully
cheerful tone, as I thought, and had evidently
been partaking of refreshment. Being asked to join
them, I did so; but ever and anon the white sheet in
the bed, which shaped itself out most fearfully into the
human form, drew my attention, and excited something
of the feeling which a ghost might have occasioned.
I had ceased in a great measure to feel for my grandmother's
death. I now felt the alarms and agitations
of superstition. It was not because she had fled from
us that I was agitated, but because that, though dead,
she still seemed present, in all the inconceivable mystery
of a dead life!</p>

<p>The funeral called forth, from the adjoining glens
and cottages, a respectable attendance, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
time gave me an opportunity of partaking, unnoticed,
of more refreshment than suited the occasion or my
years; in fact, I became little less than intoxicated,
and was exceedingly surprised at finding myself, towards
evening, in the midst of the same bush where I had experienced
my paroxysm of grief, singing aloud, in all
the exultation of exhilarated spirits. Such is infancy
and boyhood&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The tear forgot, as soon as shed."<br />
</p>

<p>I returned, however, home, thoughtful and sad, and
never, but once, thought the house so deserted and
solitary as during that evening.</p>

<p>My mother was not a Cameronian by communion,
but she was in fact one in spirit. This spirit she had
by inheritance, and it was kept alive by an occasional
visit from "Fairly." This redoubted champion of the
Covenant drew me one day towards him, and, placing
me betwixt his knees, proceeded to question me how I
would like to be a minister; and as I preserved silence,
he proceeded to explain that he did not mean a parish
minister, with a manse and glebe and stipend, but a
poor Cameronian hill-preacher like himself. As he
uttered these last words, I looked up, and saw before
me an austere countenance, and a threadbare black coat
hung loosely over what is termed a hunchback. I had
often heard Fairly mentioned, not only with respect,
but enthusiasm, and had already identified him and his
followers with the "guid auld persecuted folks" of
whom I had heard so much. Yet there was something
so strange, not to say forbidding, in Fairly's appearance,
that I hesitated to give my consent, and continued
silent; whereupon Fairly rose to depart, observing to
my mother, that "my time was not come yet." I did
not then fully comprehend the meaning of this expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>sion,
nor do I perhaps now, but it passed over my heart
like an awakening breeze over the strings of an Æolian
harp. I immediately sprang forward, and catching
Fairly by the skirt of his coat, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh stay, sir!&mdash;dinna gang and leave us, and I
will do onything ye like."</p>

<p>"But then mind, my wee man," continued Fairly in
return, "mind that, if ye join us, ye will have neither
house nor hame, and will often be cauld and hungry,
without a bed to lie on."</p>

<p>"I dinna care," was my uncouth, but resolute
response.</p>

<p>"There's mair metal in that callant than ye're aware
o'," rejoined Fairly, addressing himself to my mother,
and looking all the while most affectionately into my
countenance. "Here, my little fellow, here's a penny
for ye, to buy a <i>charitcher</i>; and gin ye leeve to be a
man, ye'll aiblins be honoured wi' upholding the doctrines
which it contains, on the mountain and in the
glen, when my auld banes are mixed wi' the clods."</p>

<p>I looked again at Fairly as he pronounced these
words, and had an angel descended from heaven in all
the radiance and benignity of undimmed glory, such a
presence would not have impressed me more deeply
with feelings of love, veneration, and esteem.</p>

<p>This colloquy, short as it was, exercised considerable
influence over my future life.</p>

<p>I cannot suppose anything more imposing, and better
calculated to excite the imagination, than the meetings
of these Cameronians or hill-men. They are still vividly
under my view: the precipitous and green hills of Durrisdeer
on each side&mdash;the tent adjoining to the pure mountain
stream beneath&mdash;the communion table stretching
away in double rows from the tent towards the acclivity&mdash;the
vast multitude in one wide amphitheatre round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and above&mdash;the spring gushing solemnly and copiously
from the rock, like that of Meribah, for the refreshment
of the people&mdash;the still or whispering silence
when Fairly appeared, with the Bible under his arm,
without gown, or band, or any other clerical badge of
distinction&mdash;the tent-ladder, ascended by the bald-headed
and venerable old man, and his almost divine
regard of benevolence, cast abroad upon a countless
multitude&mdash;his earnestness in prayer&mdash;his plain and
colloquial style of address&mdash;the deep and pious attention
paid to him, from the plaided old woman at the
front of the tent to the gaily dressed lad and lass on
the extremity of the ground&mdash;his descent, and the
communion service&mdash;his solemn and powerful consecration
prayer, over which the passing cloud seemed to
hover, and the sheep on the hill-side to forego for a
time their pasture&mdash;his bald head (like a bare rock
encompassed with furze) slightly fringed with grey
hairs, remaining uncovered under the plashing of a
descending torrent, and his right hand thrust upward,
in holy indignation against the proffered umbrella;&mdash;all
this I see under the alternating splendours and
darkenings, lights and shadows, of a sultry summer's
day. The thunder is heard in its awful sublimity;
and whilst the hearts of man and of beast are quaking
around and above, Fairly's voice is louder and more
confirmed, his countenance is brighter, and his eye
more assured, and stedfastly fixed on the muttering
heaven. "Thou, O Lord, art ever near us, but we
perceive Thee not; Thou speakest from Zion, and in
a still small voice, but it is drowned in the world's
murmurings. Then Thou comest forth as now, in thy
throne of darkness, and encompassest thy Sinai with
thunderings and lightnings; and then it is, that like
silly and timid sheep who have strayed from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pasture, we stand afar off and tremble. <i>This</i> flash
of thy indignant majesty, which has now crossed these
aged eyes, might, hadst Thou but so willed it, have
dimmed them for ever; and this vast assemblage of
sinful life might have been, in the twinkling of an eye,
as the hosts of Assyria, or the inhabitants of Admah
and Zeboim; but Thou knowest, O Lord, that Thou
hast more work for me, and more mercy for them, and
that the prayers of penitence which are now knocking
hard for entrance and answer, must have time and
trial to prove their sincerity. So be it, good Lord!
for thine ire, that hath suddenly kindled, hath passed;
and the Sun of Righteousness himself hath bid his
own best image come forth from the cloud to enliven
our assembly." In fact, the thunder-cloud had passed,
and under the strong relief of a renewed effulgence,
was wrapping in its trailing ascent the summits of the
more distant mountains.</p>

<p>
"I to the hills will lift mine eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From whence doth come mine aid:</span><br />
My safety cometh from the Lord"&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>These were the notes which pealed in the after-service
of that memorable occasion from at least ten thousand
hearts. Nor is there any object in nature better calculated
to call forth the most elevated sentiments of
devotion, than such a simultaneous concordant union
of voice and purpose, in praise of Him "who heaven
and earth hath made."</p>

<p>
"All people that on earth do dwell,<br />
Sing to the Lord"&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>So says the divine monitor; but what says modern
fashion and refinement? Let them answer in succession
for themselves. And first, then, in reference
to fashion. When examined and duly purged, she
deposeth that the time was when men were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
ashamed to praise their God "before his people
all;" when they even rejoiced with what tones they
might to unite their tributary stream of praise to
that vast flood which rolled, in accumulated efficacy,
towards the throne on high; when lord and lady,
husbandman and mechanic, learned and unlearned,
prince and people, sent forth their hearts in their
united voices towards Him who is the God over all
and the Saviour of all. She further deposeth that
the venerated founders of our Presbyterian Church
were wont to scare the curlew and the bittern of the
mountain and the marsh by their nightly songs of
solemn and combined thanksgiving and praise; and
that, with the view of securing a continuance of this
delightful exercise, our Confession of Faith strictly
enjoins us, providing, by the reading of "the line,"
against cases of extreme ignorance or bodily infirmity;
and yet she averreth that, in defiance of law and practice,
of reason and revelation, of good feeling and
common-sense, hath it become unfashionable to be
seen or to be heard praising God. It is vulgar and
unseemly, it would appear, in the extreme, to modulate
the voice or to compose the countenance into any form
or expression which might imply an interest in the
exercise of praise. The young Miss in her teens,
whose tender and susceptible heart is as wax to impressions,
is half betrayed into a spontaneous exhibition
of devotional feeling; but she looks at the marble
countenance and changeless aspect of Mamma, and is
silent. The home-bred, unadulterated peasant would
willingly persevere in a practice to which he has been
accustomed from his first entrance at the church stile;
but his superiors, from pew and gallery, discountenance
his feelings, and indicate by the carelessness&mdash;I had
almost added the levity&mdash;of their demeanour, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
they are thinking of anything, of everything, but
God's praise; whilst the voices of the hired precentor
and of a few old women and rustics are heard
uniting in suppressed and feeble symphony. Nay,
there is a case still more revolting than any which has
been hitherto denounced&mdash;that, namely, of our young
probationers and ministers, who, in many instances,
refuse even in the pulpit that example which, with
their last breath, they were perhaps employed in recommending.
There they sit or stoop whilst the
psalm is singing, busily employed in revising their MS.,
or in reviewing the congregation, in selecting and
marking for emphasis the splendid passages, or in
noting for observation whatever of interesting the
dress or the countenances of the people may suggest.
So much for <i>fashion</i>; and now for the deposition of
<i>refinement</i> on the same subject.</p>

<p>Refinement has indeed much to answer for; she has
brushed the coat threadbare; she has wiredrawn the
thread till it can scarcely support its own weight; and
in no one instance has her besetting sin been more
conspicuous than in her intercommunings with our
church psalmody. The old women who, from the
original establishment of Presbytery, have continued
to occupy and grace our pulpit stairs, are oftentimes
defective in point of sweetness and delicacy of voice;
in fact, they do not sing, but croon, and in some instances
they have even been known to outrun the
precentor by several measures, and to return upon
him a second time ere the conclusion of the line.
What then?&mdash;they always croon in a low key; and
if <i>they</i> are gratified, their Maker pleased, and the congregation
in general undisturbed, the principal parties
are disposed of. There is no doubt something unpleasing
to a refined ear in the jarring concord of a rustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
euphony, when, in full voice, of a sacramental Sabbath
evening, they are inclined to hold on with irresistible
swing. But what they want in harmony, they have in
good-will; what they lose in melody, they gain in the
ringing echo of their voices from roof and ceiling. And
were it possible, without silencing the uninstructed, to
gratify and encourage the refined and the disciplined,
then were there at once a union and a unison of agreeables;
but as this object has never been effected, or even
attempted, and as refinement has at once laid aside all
regard for the humble and untrained worshipper, and
has set her stamp and seal upon a trained band of vocal
performers, it becomes the duty of all rightly constituted
minds to oppose, if they cannot stem the tide&mdash;to
mark and stigmatize that as unbecoming and absurd
which the folly of the age would have us consider as
improvement. It is of little moment whether the office
of psalm-singing be committed to a select band, who
surround, with their merry faces and tenor pipes, the
precentor's seat, or be entrusted to separate parties
scattered through the congregation; still, so long as
the <i>taught</i> alone are expected to sing, the original end
of psalm-singing is lost sight of, the habits of a Presbyterian
congregation are violated, and <i>manner</i> being
preferred to <i>matter</i>&mdash;an attuned voice to a fervent
spirit&mdash;a manifest violence is done to the feelings of
the truly devout.</p>

<p>No two things are probably more distinct and separate
in the reader's mind than preaching and fishing; yet in
mine they are closely associated.</p>

<p>And is not fishing or angling with the rod a most
fascinating amusement? There is just enough of
address required to admit and imply a gratifying
admixture of self-approbation; and enough, at the
same time, of chance or circumstance, over which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
fisher has no control, to keep expectation alive even
during the most deplorable luck. Hence a real fisher
is seldom found, from want of success merely, to relinquish
his rod in disgust; but, with the spirit of a
true hill-man of the old school, he is patient in tribulation,
rejoicing in hope. "<i>Meliore opera</i>" is written
upon his countenance; and whilst mischance and misfortune
haunt him, it may be, from stream to stream,
or from pool to pool, he still looks down the glen and
along the river's course; he still regards in anxious
expectation the alluring and more promising curl, the
circulating and creamy froth, the suddenly broken and
hesitating gullet, and the dark clayey bank, under
which the water runs thick and the foam-bells figure
bright and starry. He knows that one single hour of
successful adventure, when the cloud has ascended and
the shadow is deep, and the breeze comes upwards on
the stream, and the whole finny race are in eager expectation
of the approaching shower&mdash;that one single
hour of this description will amply repay him for every
discouragement and misfortune.</p>

<p>And who that has enjoyed this one little hour of
success would consider the purchase as dearly made?
Is it with bait that you are angling?&mdash;and in the solitude
of a mountain glen can you discover the stream of
your hope, stretching away like a blue pennant waving
into the distance, and escaping from view behind some
projecting angle of the hill? Your fishing-rod is tight
and right, your line is in order, your hook penetrates
your finger to the barb; other companions than the
plover, the lark, and the water-wagtail you have none.
This is no hour for chirping grasshopper, or flaunting
butterfly, or booming bee; the overshaded and ruffled
water receives your bait with a plump; and ere it has
travelled to the distance of six feet, it is nailed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to the leeward of a stone. You pull recklessly and
fearlessly, and flash after flash, and flap after flap,
comes there in upon your hull the spotted and ponderous
inmate of the flood! Or is it the fly with
which you are plying the river's fuller and more seaward
flow? The wide extent of streamy pool is before
you, and beyond your reach. Fathom after fathom
goes reeling from your pirn, but still you are barely
able to drop the far fly into the distant curl. "Habet!"
he has it; and proudly does he bear himself in the
plenitudes of strength, space, and freedom. Your line
cuts and carves the water into all manner of squares,
triangles, and parallelograms. Now he makes a few
capers in the air, and shows you, as an opera dancer
would do, his proportions and agility: now again he is
sulky and restive, and gives you to understand that the
<i>vis inertiæ</i> is strong within him. But fate is in all his
operations, and his last convulsive effort makes the sand
and the water commingle at the landing-place.</p>

<p>The resort of the fisher is amidst the retirements of
what, and what alone, can be justly denominated undegraded
nature. The furnace, and the manufactory,
and the bleaching-green, and the tall red smoke-vomiting
chimney are his utter aversion. The village,
the clachan, the city, he avoids: he flies from
them as something intolerably hostile to his hopes.
He holds no voluntary intercourse with man, or with
his petty and insignificant achievements. "He lifts
his eyes to the hills," and his steps lie through the
retired glen, and winding vale, and smiling strath, up
to the misty eminence and cairn-topped peak. He
catches the first beams of the sun, not through the
dim and disfiguring smoke of a city, but over the
sparkling and diamonded mountain, above the unbroken
and undulating line of the distant horizon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
His conversation is with heaven, with the mist, and the
cloud, and the sky; the great, the unmeasured, the incomprehensible
are around him; and all the agitation
and excitement to which his hopes and fears as a mere
fisher subject him, cannot completely withdraw his soul
from that character of sublimity by which the mountain
solitude is so perceptibly impressed.</p>

<p>I shall never forget one day's sport. The morning
was warm, and in fact somewhat sultry; and swarms
of insects arose on my path. As every gullet was
gushing with water, it behoved me to ascend, even
beyond my former travel, to the purest streams or
feeders, which ran unseen, in general, among the hills.
The clouds, as I hurried on my way, began to gather
up into a dense and darkening awning. There was a
slight and somewhat hesitating breeze on the hill-side,
for I could see the heath and bracken bending under
it, but it was scarcely perceptible beneath. This, however,
I regretted the less, as the mountain torrent to
which I had attached myself was too precipitous and
streamy in its course to require the aids of wind and
curl to forward the sport. Let the true fisher&mdash;for he
only can appreciate the circumstances&mdash;say what must
have been my delight, my rapture, as I proceeded to
prepare my rod, open out my line over the brink of a
gullet, along which the water rushed like porter through
the neck of a bottle, and at the lower extremity of which
the froth tilted round and round in most inviting eddies!
Here there was no springing of trouts to the surface,
nor coursing of alarmed shoals beneath. The darkened
heaven was reflected back by the darker water; and
the torrent kept dashing, tumbling, and brawling along
under the impulse and agitation of a swiftly ebbing
flood. I had hit upon that very critical shade, betwixt
the high brown and soft blue colour, which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mountain angler knows well how to appreciate; and I
felt as if every turn and entanglement of my line
formed a barrier betwixt me and paradise. The very
first throw was successful, ere the bait had travelled
twice round the eddy at the bottom of the gullet.
When trouts in such circumstances take at all, they do
so in good earnest. They are all on the outlook for
food, and dash at the swiftly-descending bait with a
freedom and good-will which almost uniformly insures
their capture. And here, for the benefit of bait fishers,
it may be proper to mention, that success depends not
so much on the choosing and preparing of the worms&mdash;though
these undoubtedly are important points&mdash;as in
the throwing and drawing, or rather dragging of the
line. In such mountain rapids, the trout always turn
their heads to the current, and never gorge the bait
till they have placed themselves lower down in the
water; consequently, by pulling <i>downwards</i>, two manifest
advantages are gained: the trout is often hooked
without gorging, or even biting at all, and the current
assists the fisher in landing his prize, which, in such
circumstances, may be done in an instant, and at a
single pull. But to return. My success on this occasion
was altogether beyond precedent: at every turn
and wheel of the winding torrent, I was sure to grace the
green turf or sandy channel with another and another
yellow-sided and brightly-spotted half-pounder. The
very sheep, as they travelled along their mountain pathway,
stopped and gazed down on the sport. The season
was harvest, and the Lammas floods had brought up the
bull or sea trouts. I had all along hoped that one or
two stragglers might have reached my position; and this
hope had animated every pull. It was not, however,
till the day was well advanced, that I had the good
fortune to succeed in hooking a large, powerful, active,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and new-run "milter." In fisher weight he might
seem <i>five</i>, but in imperial he would possibly not exceed
two or three pounds. Immediately upon his feeling
the steel he plunged madly, flung himself into the air,
dived again into the depths, and flounced about in the
most active and courageous style imaginable. At last,
taking the stream-head somewhat suddenly, he showed
tail and fin above the surface of the water, brought his
two extremities almost into contact, shot himself upwards
like an arrow, and was off with the hook and a
yard of line ere I had time to prepare against the
danger; but as unforeseen circumstances led to this
catastrophe, occurrences equally unlooked-for repaired
the loss; for in an instant I secured the disengaged
captive whilst floundering upon the sand, having, by
his headlong precipitancy, fairly pitched himself out of
his native element. There he lay, like a ship in the
shallows, exhibiting scale and fin, and shoulder and
spot, of the most fascinating hue; and, ever and anon,
as the recollection of the fatal precipitancy seemed to
return upon him, he cut a few capers and exhibited a
few somersets, which contributed materially to insure
his capture, and increase my delight.</p>

<p>By this time I had ascended nearly to the source of
the stream; and at every opening up of the glen I
could perceive a sensible diminution of the current. I
was quite alone in the solitude; and my unwonted
success had rendered me insensible to the escape of
time. The glen terminated at last in a linn and scaur,
beyond which it did not appear probable that trouts
would ascend. Whilst I was engaged in the consideration
of the objects around me, with a reference to my
return home, I became all at once enveloped in mist and
darkness. The mist was dense and close and suffocating,
while the darkness increased every instant. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a difficulty in breathing, as if I had been shut up in an
empty oven; my situation stared me at once in the
face, and I took to my heels over the heath, in what I
considered a homeward direction. Now that my ears
were relieved from the gurgling sound of the water, I
could perceive, through the stillness of the air, that the
thunder was behind me. I had been taught to consider
thunder as the voice of the "Most High," when He
speaks in his wrath, and felt my whole soul prostrated
under the divine rebuke. Some passages of the 18th
Psalm rushed on my remembrance; and as the lightnings
began to kindle, and the thunder to advance, I
could hear myself involuntarily repeating&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Up from his nostrils came a smoke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from his mouth there came</span><br />
Devouring fire; and coals by it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were turned into flame.</span><br />
<br />
"The Lord God also in the heavens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did thunder in his <i>ire</i>,</span><br />
And there the Highest gave his voice&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hail-stones and coals of fire."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Such was the subject of my meditation, as the muttering
and seemingly subterraneous thunder boomed and
quavered behind me. At last, one broad and whizzing
flash passed over, around, beneath, and I could almost
imagine, <i>through</i> me. The clap followed instantly, and,
by its deafening knell, drove me head foremost into
the heathy moss. Had the earth now opened (as to
Curtius of old) before me, I should certainly have
dashed into the crater, in order to escape from that
explosive omnipotence which seemed to overtake me.
Peal after peal pitched, with a rending and tearing
sound, upon the drum of my ear and the parapet of
my brain; whilst the mist and the darkness were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
kindled up around me into an open glow. I could
hear a strange rush upon the mountain, and along the
glen, as if the Solway had overleaped all bounds, and
was careering some thousand feet abreast over Criffel
and Queenberry. Down it came at last, in a swirl and
a roar, as if rocks and cairns and heath were commingled
in its sweep. This terrible blast was only the
immediate precursor of a hail-storm, which, descending
at first in separate and distinct pieces, as if the powers
of darkness and uproar had been pitching marbles,
came on at last with a rush, as if Satan himself had
been dumriddling the elements. The water in the
moss-hag rose up, and boiled and sputtered in the face
of heaven, and a rock, underneath the hollow corner of
which I had now crept on hands and knees, rattled all
over, as if assailed by musketry. I lay now altogether
invisible to mortal eye, amidst the mighty movements
of the elements&mdash;a thing of nought, endeavouring to
crawl into nonentity&mdash;a tiny percipient amidst the
blind urgency of nature. I lay in all the prostration
of a bruised and subdued spirit, praying fervently and
loudly unto God that He might be pleased to cover me
with his hand till his wrath was overpast. And, to my
persuasion at the time, my prayers were not altogether
insufficient: the storm softened, rain succeeded hail, a
pause followed the hurricane, and the thunder's voice
had already travelled away over the brow of the onward
mountain.</p>

<p>Whilst I was debating with myself whether it were
safer, now that the night had fairly closed in upon the
pathless moor, to remain all night in my present position,
or to attempt once more my return home, I heard,
all of a sudden, the sound of human voices, which the
violence of the storm had prevented me from sooner
perceiving. I scarcely knew whether I was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
alarmed or comforted by this discovery. From my
previous state of agitation, combined with my early
and rooted belief in all manner of supernaturals, I was
strongly disposed to terror; but the accents were so
manifestly human, that, in spite of my apprehensions,
they tended to cheer me. As I continued, therefore, to
listen with mouth and ears, the voices became louder
and louder, and more numerous, mixed and commingled
as they appeared at last to be with the tread and the
plash of horses' feet. These demonstrations of an approaching
cavalcade naturally called upon me to narrow,
as much and as speedily as possible, my circumference;
in other words, to creep, as it were, into my
shell, by occupying the farthest extremity of the recess,
to which I betook myself at first for shelter, and
now for concealment. There I lay like a limpet stuck
to the rock, against which I could feel my heart beat
with accelerated rapidity. In this situation I could
distinguish voices and expressions, and ultimately unravel
the import of a conversation interlarded with
oaths and similar ornamental flourishes. There was a
proposal to halt, alight, and refresh in this sequestered
situation. Such a proposal, as may readily be supposed,
was to me anything but agreeable. Here was I, according
to my reckoning, surrounded by a band of
robbers, and liable every instant to detection. Firearms
were talked of, and preparations, offensive and
defensive, were proposed. I could distinctly smell
gunpowder. In the meantime, a fire was struck up at
no great distance, under the glare of which I could distinguish
horses heavily panniered, and strange-looking
countenances, congregating within fifty paces of my
retreat. The shadow of the intervening corner of the
rock covered me, otherwise immediate detection would
have been inevitable. The thunder and lightnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with all their terrors were nothing to this. In the one
case, I was placed at the immediate disposal of a merciful,
as well as a mighty Being; but at present I ran
every risk of falling into the hands of those whose
counsels I had overheard, and whose tender mercies
were only cruelty. As I lay&mdash;rod, basket, and fish
crumpled up into a corner of contracted dimensions&mdash;all
ear, however, and eye towards the light&mdash;I could
mark the shadows of several individuals who were manifestly
engaged in the peaceful and ordinary process of
eating and drinking; hands, arms, and flagons projected
in lengthened obscurity over the mass, and intimated,
by the rapidity and character of their movements, that
jaws were likewise in motion. The long pull, with the
accompanying <i>smack</i>, were likewise audible; and it was
manifest that the repast was not more substantial than
the beverage was exhilarating. "Word follows word,
from question answer flows." Dangers and contingencies&mdash;which,
while the flame was kindling and the
flagon was filling, seemed to agitate and interest all&mdash;were
now talked of as bugbears; and oaths of heavy
and horrifying defiance were hurled into the ear of
night, with many concomitant expressions of security
and self-reliance. The night, though dark, had now
become still and warm; and the ground which they
occupied, like my own retreat, had been partially protected
from the hail and the rain by the projecting
rock. The stunted roots of burnt heath, or "brins,"
served them plentifully for fuel; and altogether their
situation was not so uncomfortable as might have been
expected. Still, however, their character, employment,
and conversation appeared to me a fearful mystery.
One thing, however, was evident, that they conceived
themselves as engaged in some illegal transactions.
Their whole revel was tainted with treason and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>subordination:
kings and rulers were disposed of with
little ceremony; and excise officers, in particular, were
visited with anathemas not to be mentioned. At this
critical moment, when the whole party seemed verging
towards downright intoxication, a pistol bullet burst
itself to atoms on the projecting corner of the rock;
and the report which accompanied this demonstration
was followed up by oaths of challenge and imprecation.
The fire went out as if by magic, and an immediate
rush to arms, accompanied by shots and clashing of
lethal weapons, indicated a struggle for life.</p>

<p>"Stand and surrender, you smuggling scoundrels!
or by all that is sacred, not one of you shall quit this
spot in life!"</p>

<p>This salutation was answered by a renewed discharge
of musketry; and the darkness, which was relieved by
the momentary flash, became instantly more impenetrable
than ever. Men evidently pursued men, and
horses were held by the bridle, or driven into speed as
circumstances permitted. How it happened that I
neither screamed, fainted, nor died outright, I am yet
at a loss to determine. The darkness, however, was
my covering; and even amidst the unknown horrors of
the onset, I felt in some degree assured by the extinction
of the fire. But this assurance was not of long continuance:
the assailing party had evidently taken possession
of the field; and, after a few questions of mutual
recognition and congratulation, proceeded to secure
their booty, which consisted of one horse, with a considerable
assortment of barrels and panniers. This was
done under the light of the rekindled fire, around which
a repetition of the former festivities was immediately
commenced. The fire, however, now flared full in my
face, and led to my immediate detection. I was summoned
to come forth, with the muzzle of a pistol placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
within a few inches of my ear&mdash;an injunction which I
was by no means prepared to resist. I rolled immediately
outwards from under the rock, displaying my
basket and rod, and screaming all the while heartily for
mercy. At this critical moment a horse was heard to
approach, and a challenge was immediately sent through
the darkness,&mdash;every musket was levelled in the direction
of the apprehended danger,&mdash;when a voice, to
which I was by no means a stranger, immediately restored
matters to their former bearing.</p>

<p>"Now, what is the meaning o' a' this, my lads?
And how come the king's servants to be sae ill lodged
at this time o' night? He must be a shabby landlord
that has naething better than the bare heath and the
hard rock to accommodate his guests wi'."</p>

<p>"Oh, Fairly, my old man of the Covenant," vociferated
the leader of the party, "how come you to be
keeping company with the whaup and the curlew at
this time o' night? But a drink is shorter than a tale;
fling the bridle owre the grey yad's shoulders, an' ca'
her to the bent, till we mak ourselves better acquainted
with this little natty gentleman, whom we have so
opportunely encountered on the moor"&mdash;displaying, at
the same time, a keg or small flask of liquor referred to,
and shaking it joyously till it clunked again.</p>

<p>In an instant Fairly was stationed by the side of the
fire, with a can of Martin's brandy in his hands, and an
expression of exceeding surprise on his countenance as
he perceived my mother's son in full length exhibited
before him. I did not, however, use the ceremony of
a formal recognition; but, rushing on his person, I
clung to it with all the convulsive desperation of a
person drowning. Matters were now adjusted by
mutual recognitions and explanations; and I learned
that I had been the unconscious spectator of a scuffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
betwixt the "king's officers" and a "band of smugglers;"
and that Fairly, who had been preaching and baptizing
that day at Burnfoot, and was on his return towards
Durrisdeer (where he was next day to officiate), had
heard and been attracted to the spot by the firing. In
these times to which I refer, the Isle of Man formed a
depot for illegal traffic. Tea, brandy, and tobacco, in
particular, found their way from the Calf of Man to
the Rinns of Galloway, Richmaden, and the mouth of
the Solway. From the latter depot the said articles
were smuggled, during night marches, into the interior,
through such byways and mountain passes as were
unfrequented or inaccessible. After suitable libations
had been made, I was mounted betwixt a couple of
panniers, and soon found myself in my own bed, some
time before</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DETECTIVES_TALE" id="THE_DETECTIVES_TALE"></a>THE DETECTIVE'S TALE.</h2>

<h3>THE CHANCE QUESTION.</h3>


<p>It is not long since the cleverest of these strangely constituted
men called detectives [<i>entre nous</i> myself] went
up to his superintendent with a very rueful face, and
told him that all his energies were vain in discovering
a clue to an extensive robbery of plate which had occurred
in &mdash;&mdash; Street some short time before.</p>

<p>"I confess myself fairly baffled," he said; and could
say no more.</p>

<p>"With that singular foxhound organ of yours?"
replied his superior. "The herring must have been
well smoked."</p>

<p>"At the devil's own fire of pitch and brimstone,"
said the detective. "But the worst is, I have had no
trail to be taken off. I never was so disconcerted
before. Generally some object to point direction, if
even only a dead crow or smothered sheep; but here,
not even that."</p>

<p>"No trace of P&mdash;&mdash; or any of the English gang?"</p>

<p>"None; all beyond the bounds, or up chimneys, or
down in cellars, or covered up in coal-bunkers. I am
beginning to think the job to be of home manufacture."</p>

<p>"Generally a clumsy affair; and therefore very easy
for a man of your parts. What reason have you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely none."</p>

<p>"That is, I fancy," said the superintendent, "the
thousand pounds of good silver, watches, and rings, are
absolutely gone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know my conditions," said the officer: "give
me the thing stolen, and I will find to a living certainty
the man who stole it; or give me the man who stole it,
and I will find you to a dead certainty the thing stolen.
But it's a deuced unfortunate thing that a man can't get
even a sniff."</p>

<p>"Yes, especially when, as in your case, all his soul
is in his nose."</p>

<p>"And with such a reward!" continued the chagrined
officer; "scarcely anything so liberal has been offered
in my time; but, after all, the reward is nothing&mdash;it is
the honour of the force and one's character. It is well
up for the night anyhow, and I rather think altogether,
unless some flash come by telegraph."</p>

<p>"You have no other place you can go to now?" said
the superintendent musingly, and not altogether satisfied.</p>

<p>"None," replied the officer resolutely. "I have been
out of bed for ten nights&mdash;every den scoured, and every
'soup-kitchen'<a name="FNanchor_2_" id="FNanchor_2_"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> visited, every swell watched and dogged,
and every trull searched; I can do no more. It is now
eleven, my eyes will hardly hold open, and I request to
be allowed to go and rest for the present."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_" id="Footnote_2_"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Places for melting plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p></div>

<p>"As you like," replied the superintendent. "We
are neither omniscient nor omnipotent."</p>

<p>"The people who get robbed think us both," said the
officer; and taking his hat, left the office, and began to
trudge slowly down the street. The orderly people had
mostly retired to their homes. The midnight ghouls
from the deep wynds and closes were beginning to
form their gossiping clusters; the perambulators had
begun their courses; and fast youths from the precincts
of the College or the New Town were resuming their
search for sprees, or determined to make them. There</p>

<p>were among them many clients of our officer, whom he
knew, and had hopes of at some future day; but now
he surveyed them with the eye of one whose occupation
for the time was gone. His sadness was of the colour
of Jacques', but there was a difference: the one wove
out of his melancholy golden verses in the forest of
Arden; our hero could not draw out of his even silver
plate in the dens of Edinburgh. He had come to the
Tron Kirk, and hesitated whether, after all, he should
renounce his hunt for the night&mdash;true to the peculiarity
of this species of men, whose game are wretched and
wicked beings, always less or more between them and
the wind's eye, and therefore always stimulating to
pursuit; but again he resolved upon home, or, rather,
his heavy eyes and worn-out spirits resolved him, in
spite of himself, and he turned south, in which direction
his residence was. So on he trudged till he came about
the middle part of the street called the South Bridge,
when he heard pattering behind him the feet of a
woman. She came up to him, and passed him, or
rather was in the act of passing him, when, from something
no better than a desire to stimulate activity, or
rather to free himself from the conviction that he was
utterly and entirely defeated, he turned round to the
girl, whom he saw in an instant was a street-walker,
and threw carelessly a question at her.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Home," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"In Simon Square."</p>

<p>Here he was at first inclined to make a stop, having
put the questions more as common routine than with
any defined intention; but just as the girl came opposite
to a lamp-post, and was on the eve of outstripping
him, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, by-the-bye, do you know any one thereabouts,
or anywhere else, who mends rings?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Abram."</p>

<p>"What more?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his other name; we just call him
Abram, and sometimes Jew Abram."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get anything mended by him?"</p>

<p>"No; but I bought a ring from him once."</p>

<p>"And what did you do with it?"</p>

<p>"I have it on my finger," she replied.</p>

<p>"Will you let me see it?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>And as they came forward to another lamp-post, he
was shown the ring. He examined it carefully, taking
from his waistcoat another, and comparing the two&mdash;"Won't
do."</p>

<p>"How long is it since you made this purchase?"</p>

<p>"About ten days ago."</p>

<p>"And what did you pay for it?"</p>

<p>"Three and sixpence."</p>

<p>By this time they had got opposite the square where
the girl lived. She crossed, and he followed, in the
meantime asking her name.</p>

<p>"There is Abram's house," she said; "there's light
in the window."</p>

<p>And the officer, standing a little to see where she
went, now began to examine the outside of Abram's
premises. A chink in the shutters showed him a part
of the person of some one inside, whom he conjectured
to be Abram sitting at his work. He opened the door,
and it was as he thought. An old man was sitting
at a bench, with a pair of nippers in his hand, peering
into some small object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you mend that?" said the officer abruptly,
and, without a word of prelocution, pressing into his
hands a ring.</p>

<p>"Anything," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the ring come under the glance
of his far-ben eye&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ah! ye-es&mdash;well&mdash;no&mdash;no."</p>

<p>And the peering eye came, as it were, forward out
of its recess, and scanned the face of the officer, who,
on the other hand, was busy watching every turn of
the Jew's features.</p>

<p>"No; I cannot mend that."</p>

<p>"Why? You said you could mend anything."</p>

<p>"Ye-es, anything; but not that."</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;no harm in asking," replied the officer,
as he looked round the apartment, and fixed his eye on
the back wall, where, in utter opposition to all convenience,
let alone taste, and even to the exclusion of
required space, there were battered two or three coarse
engravings."</p>

<p>"Good night!"</p>

<p>"Goo-ood night!"</p>

<p>"Now what, in the name of decoration, are these
prints hung up on that wall for?" asked the officer of
himself, without making any question of the import of
the Jew's look, and his yes and no. He was now standing
in the middle of the square, and, turning round, he
saw the light put out. Another thought struck him,
but whatever it was, it was the cause of a laugh that
took hold of him, even in the grasp of his anxiety;
yea, he laughed, for a detective, greatly more heartily
than could be authorized by anything I have recorded.</p>

<p>"Why, the lower print is absolutely the old Jewish
subject of the cup in the sack," he muttered, and
laughed again.  "Was ever detective so favoured? <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
&mdash;a representation of concealed treasure on the very
wall where that treasure is! Were the brethren fools
enough to put the representation of a cup on Benjamin's
sack?"</p>

<p>"Robertson!" he called to one of his men, whom,
by the light at the street-end of the entry, he saw
passing, "send two men here upon the instant."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>And then he began to examine more thoroughly the
premises, to ascertain whether there were any exit-openings
besides the door and window. There were
none. He had a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes
to wait, and five of these had not passed before he
observed some one go up and tap at Abram's door. A
question, though he did not hear it, must have been
put by the Jew, for an answer, in a low voice, responded,</p>

<p>"Slabberdash!"</p>

<p>"The crack name of that fellow Clinch, whom I've
been after for a week," said the officer to himself, as
he kept in the shadow of a cellar which jutted out
from the other houses.</p>

<p>The Jew had again answered, for the visitor repeated
to himself, as if in fear and surprise, "Red-light," and,
looking cautiously about him, made off.</p>

<p>"It is not my cue to follow," muttered the detective;
"but I will do next best."</p>

<p>And hurrying out of the mouth of the entry at the
heels of the visitor, he caught the policeman on the
Nicolson Street beat almost immediately.</p>

<p>"Track that fellow," he said; "there&mdash;there, you see
him&mdash;'tis Slabberdash; do not leave him or the front
of his den till sunrise. I'll get a man for your beat."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the policeman, adroitly blowing
out his bull's-eye and making off at a canter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer returned to his post, and within the time
the two assistants arrived.</p>

<p>"Go you, Reid, to the office, and send a man to
supply Nicolson Street beat till Ogilvy return; he's on
commission; come back instantly."</p>

<p>The man obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>"And now, Jones, you and your neighbour take
charge of that door&mdash;keep seeing it without it seeing;
you understand? Keep watch; and if any one approach,
scan him for Slabberdash, but take care he
doesn't see you. I will relieve you at shutters-down in
the morning; meanwhile, I'm at home for report or
exigency."</p>

<p>"I comprehend," replied the man, "and will be
careful."</p>

<p>The officer took for home, weary and drowsy, though
a little awakened by the events of one half-hour. There
was sight of game, as well as scent. The Jew's look
by itself was not much, yet greatly more to the eye of
a detective than even an expert physiognomist could
imagine. The picture-plastered wall was more; the
cup in the sack was merely an enlivening joke; but
Slabberdash was no joke, as many a douce burgher in
Edinburgh knew to his cost. The fellow was a match
for the father of cheats and lies himself; and therefore
it could be no dishonour to our clever detective
that hitherto he had had no chance with him, any more
than if he had been James Maccoul, or the great
Mahoun.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other watch having arrived, the two
kept up their surveillance; nor would they be without
something to report to their officer, were it nothing
more than that little Abram&mdash;for he was very diminutive&mdash;about
one in the morning rather surprised one
of the guard, who was incautiously too near the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
by slowly opening the door, and looking out with an
inquiring eye, in his shirt; and upon getting a glimpse
of the dark figure of the policeman, saying, as if to
himself, though intended for the said dark figure, whoever
it might be,</p>

<p>"I vash wondering if it vash moonlight."</p>

<p>And, shutting the door hurriedly, he disappeared.
About an hour afterwards, a tall female figure, coming
up the entry from North Richmond Street, made a full
stop, at about three yards from Abram's door, and then
darted off, but not before one of the guard had seen
enough, as he thought, to enable him to swear that it
was Slabberdash's companion, a woman known by the
slang name of Four-toed Mary, once one of the most
dashing and beautiful of the local street-sirens. About
an hour after that the two guards forgathered to compare
notes.</p>

<p>"The devil is surely in that little man," said the one
who had heard the soliloquy about the moon; "for,
whether or not he wanted light outside or in to drive
away the shadows of his conscience, he served his
purpose a few minutes since by lighting his lamp. I
saw the light through the chinks, and venturing to
listen, heard noises as of working. He is labouring at
something, if not sweating."</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>melting</i>," said the other, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But here comes our officer; there is never rest for
that man when there's a bird on the moor or a fox in
the covert."</p>

<p>The truth was, as the man said, the detective had
gone home to sleep; but no sooner had he lain down
than the little traces he had discovered began to excite
his imagination, and that faculty, so suggestive in his
class, getting inflamed, developed so many images in
the camera of his mind, that he soon found sleep an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
impossibility, and he was now there to know whether
anything further had transpired. The men made their
report, and he soon saw there was something more than
ordinary in Abram's curiosity about the moon, and still
more in the coincidence of the visits of Slabberdash and
Four-toes. He had a theory, too, about the working,
though it did not admit the melting. He knew better
what to augur. But he had a fault to find, and he was
not slow to find it.</p>

<p>"Why didn't one of you track Four-toes? One of
you could have served here. She has been off the
scene for three weeks, and is hiding. You ought to
have known that a woman is a good subject for a
detective. Her strength is her weakness, and her
weakness our opportunity. But there's no help for it
now. We must trace the links we have. If she come
again, be more on the alert, and follow up the track.
Keep your guard, and let not a circumstance escape
you."</p>

<p>"The light is out again," remarked one of the men;
"he has gone to bed."</p>

<p>"But not to sleep, I warrant," said his superior.
"Look sharp and listen quick, and I will be with you
when I promised."</p>

<p>He now proceeded to the office in the High Street,
where he found the superintendent waiting for a report
in another case. He recounted all he had seen and
heard.</p>

<p>"You have a chance here," said the latter; "and, to
confirm our hopes, I can tell you that Four-toes' mother
gave yesterday to a shebeen-master in Toddrick's Close,
one of the rings for a mutchkin of whisky; and, what
is more, Clinch has been traced to the old woman's
house in Blackfriars Wynd. I suspect that the picture's
true after all. The cup is verily in Benjamin's sack."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus fortified, our detective sought his way again
down the High Street; and as he had time to kill
between that and the opening of the shutters in Simon
Square, he paid a visit to Blackfriars Wynd, where he
found his faithful myrmidon keeping watch over the old
mother's house, like a Skye terrier at the mouth of a rat-hole.
He here learned that Mary with the deficient toe
had also been seen to go upstairs to her mother's garret,
which circumstance accorded perfectly with the statement
of the guard in the square, as no doubt she had
returned home after being startled at the door of Abram.
But then she was seen to go out again, about an hour
before, though whither she went the watch could not
say. The hour of appointment was now approaching.
The day had broken amidst watery clouds, driven about
by a fitful, gusty wind, and every now and then sending
stiff showers of rain, sufficient to have cooled the
enthusiasm of any one but a hunter after the doers of
evil. He had been drenched two or three times, and
now he felt that a glass of brandy was necessary as an
auxiliary to internal resistance against external aggression.
He was soon supplied, and, wending his way to
the old rendezvous, he found his guard, but without
any addition to their report of midnight. Abram was
long of getting up, and it seemed that he was first
roused by the clink of a milkwoman's tankard on the
window-shutter. The door was slowly opened, but in
place of the vendor of milk handing in to her solitary
customer the small half-pint, she went in herself, pails,
and tankard, and all. Our detective marked the circumstance
as being unusual, and, more than unusual
still, the door was partly closed upon her as she entered.
Then he began to think that she had nothing
about her of the appearance of that class of young
women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has not that woman the appearance of Four-toes?"
said the officer.</p>

<p>"I'm blowed if she's not the very woman I saw in
the dark," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Split," said the lieutenant; "but be within sign."</p>

<p>The precaution was wise. In a few minutes Abram's
face was peering out at the door, not this time looking
for the moon&mdash;more probably for the enemies of her
minions; and what immediately succeeded showed that
he had got a glimpse of the men, for by-and-by the
milk-maid came forth and proceeded along the square.</p>

<p>"Go and look into her pails," said the lieutenant to
Reid, as he hastened up to him. "Jones and I will
remain for a moment here."</p>

<p>Reid set off, and disappeared in the narrow passage
leading to West Richmond Street; but he remained
only a short time.</p>

<p>"Crumbie is yeld! there's not a drop of milk in her
pitchers," said he, on his return; "and it's no other than
Four-toes."</p>

<p>"Ah, we've been seen by Abram," said the officer;
"and the pitchers are sent away empty, which otherwise
would have contained something more valuable than
milk. After her again, and track her. Jones and I
will pay Abram a morning visit."</p>

<p>The man again set off; and the officer and Jones
having hung about a few minutes till Abram came out
to open the shutters and afford them light inside, they
caught their opportunity, and, just as the Jew was
taking down the shattered boards, they darted into the
house. Abram was at their heels in a moment.</p>

<p>"Vat ish it, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"A robbery of plate has been committed," said the
officer at once; "and I am here, with your permission
no doubt, to search this house."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very goo-ood; there ish nothing but vat ish my
property."</p>

<p>The officer had even already seen a half of the bench&mdash;which
had consisted of two parts put together, probably
originally intended for some other purpose than
mending jewellery&mdash;had been removed and placed
against the wall where Joseph and his brethren were
standing round the cup in the sack, so that it was more
difficult to reach the wall, though the device was clearly
only the half of an idea, as the prints still stood above
the bench, and might, by a sharp eye, have still suggested
the suspicion that they were intended for something
else than decoration, or even the gratification of
a Jew's love for the legends of his country. But the
officer did not go first to the suspected part. He took
a hammer from his pocket, and began rapping all round
the wall. "Stone, stone&mdash;lath, lath; ah, a compact
house."</p>

<p>"Very goo-ood. Vash only three weeks a tenant."</p>

<p>The officer recollected the estimate of the time given
by the street-walker, the <i>fons et origo</i> of all, and his
hammer went more briskly till he came to the patriarchs.
"Good head, that, of Joseph," he said with a
laugh; "hollow, eh?"</p>

<p>"Vash a good head&mdash;not hollow; the best at the
court of Pharaoh."</p>

<p>In an instant, a long chisel was through the picture;
and in another, the poker, driven into the chisel-hole,
and wrenched to a side, sent a thin covering of fir lath
into a dozen of splinters. The hand did the rest. A
cupboard was exposed to the eyes of the apparently
wondering Israelite, containing, closely packed, an array
of plate, watches, rings, and bijouterie, sufficient to make
any eye besides a Jew's leap for the wish of possession.</p>

<p>Abram held up his hands in affected wonderment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the lieutenant stood gazing at the treasure, and almost
himself entranced. Jones was fixed to the ground; at
one time looking at the costly treasure, at another at
his superior, who had already, in this department of
his art, acquired an envied reputation.</p>

<p>"Very goo-ood!" exclaimed Abram; "vash only
here three weeks. What fools to leave here all this
wonderful treasure!"</p>

<p>"Abram, will you be so good as take a walk up the
High Street? Jones will show you the way. Breakfast
will be waiting you. And do you," looking to
Jones, "send down a box large enough to hold this
silver, and two of our men to remove it to the office."</p>

<p>"Vash the other tenant," cried Abram, as he saw
the plight he had got into&mdash;"vash not me, so help me
the God of my forefathers, even Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, who were just men, as I am a just man; it vash
not me. Vash not the cup put in Benjamin's sack?"</p>

<p>The officer laughed&mdash;at this time inside, for it behoved
him now to be grave&mdash;at the recollection of the strange
coincidence of the picture and the stolen plate.</p>

<p>"Come," said Jones, "let us start;" and, clapping
the Jew's old hat on the head of the little man, he took
him under the arm to lead him out.</p>

<p>"After depositing him," whispered the officer into
Jones' ear, "get help; proceed to Blackfriars, where
Ogilvy is on the watch, and lay hold of Clinch. Some
others will start in search of Reid, who may have
tracked Four-toes, and seize her. You comprehend?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Come, Abram&mdash;unless you would like
to walk at a safe distance?"</p>

<p>"Surely I would," replied Abram; "and so would
every man who vash as innocent as the child vash
born yesterday, or this minute."</p>

<p>When the prisoner had departed, the officer sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
on the Jew's stool to rest himself, previous to making a
survey of the articles, with reference to an inventory
he had in his pocket. In this attitude, he took up a
pair of Abram's nippers to fasten a link in his watch
chain, which threatened to give way, so that he might
very well have represented the master of the establishment
sitting at his work. This observation is here
made, as explanatory of another circumstance which
presently occurred in this altogether remarkable case.
The door, which Jones had closed after him, was opened
stealthily; an old woman, wrapped up in a duffle cloak,
slipped quietly and timidly in, and going round the
end of the bench, whispered into the ear of the lieutenant&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll be Abram, nae doubt?"</p>

<p>"Ay," replied he.</p>

<p>"Ye're early at wark."</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Weel, the milk-woman&mdash;ye ken wha I mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; Four-toes."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ay, just Four-toes, that's Mary Burt; ah!
she <i>was</i> a buxom lass in my kennin'. Weel, she has
sent me to you, in a quiet way, ye ken, to tell ye that
the p'lice have an e'e on you. That ill-lookin' scoondrel,
the cleverest o' the 'tectives, as they ca' them&mdash;I never
saw him mysel, but dootless you'll ken him&mdash;has been
seen in the coort here, wi' twa o' his beagles, and you're
to tak tent."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know the ill-looking Christian dog. Vat ish
your name?"</p>

<p>"Chirsty Anderson."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, Christian?"</p>

<p>"In Wardrop's Coort, at the tap o' the lang stair.
And the milk-maid&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;says you're to shift the
things to my room i' the dark'nin', whaur Geordie, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
laddie, will hae a plank lifted, and you can stow them
awa, ayont the ken o' the cleverest o' them."</p>

<p>"And where ish the milk-woman?"</p>

<p>"In my room, pitchers an' a'."</p>

<p>"Well, tell her to keep there, as vash a prisoner,
till I come to her place."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Isn't Geordie, my good woman, called Squint?"</p>

<p>"Just the same," she replied with a laugh; "and,
ye ken, he has a right to a silver jug or twa, for he
risked his neck for't as weel as Clinch."</p>

<p>"Surely, surely."</p>

<p>"But you're to gie me a ring to tak to her, for she's
hard up, and I'll try Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;e wi' 't at night, and
get some shillings on't."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Christian&mdash;not a good name that; but
here," taking her by the shoulders, and turning sharply
in the direction of the door&mdash;for he was afraid she might
notice the wreck made in the recess,&mdash;"look out at the
door, and be on the good watch for the ill-looking
dog."</p>

<p>"Ah, Abram, ye're sae clever! The deil's in them
if they put saut on <i>your</i> tail."</p>

<p>"Here, give that to Four-toes, and tell her to keep
good prisoner till I come."</p>

<p>"Just sae&mdash;a bonny ring!"</p>

<p>"Quick! turn to your right, and go by the Pleasance,
along St. Mary's Wynd, up the High Street, to
your home."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the woman as she departed.</p>

<p>Not five minutes elapsed, when Jones and the
two assistants with the box arrived; when the officer
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jones, follow up an old woman, in a grey duffle
cloak, Christian Anderson by name, who is this moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
gone down by the Pleasance, to take St. Mary's Wynd
and the High Street on her way to her room, in Wardrop's
Court, at the top of the stair. Having seen her
landed, stop five minutes at the door, to give her time
to deliver a ring to Four-toes, then step in, and take
the young woman to the office. You will find Geordie
Anderson there also, the notorious Squint; so pick up
a man as you go, and make Squint sure."</p>

<p>"At once, sir," replied the man, and was off.</p>

<p>By-and-by, and just as our officer was beginning to
compare the plate with the inventory, the superintendent,
who had got intelligence of the discovery,
came hurrying in. They found, to their astonishment,
that every article was there, excepting two rings&mdash;the
one, probably, that offered to the shebeen-man by Four-toes'
mother, and the other that which had been presently
sent to Four-toes herself. A more complete
recovery was perhaps never achieved; and it was all
the more wonderful from the small beginning from
which the trace had been detected. Having completed
the examination and packed the treasure, which was
presently removed to the office, the discoverer set
about examining Abram's room; but so cunningly had
the whole affair of the resettership been conducted,
that there was not found a trace of any kind to show
his connection with the burglars. The joke of the
man in reference to the process of melting had, however,
had a narrow escape from being realized; for a
kind of furnace had been erected with bricks, and a
large crucible, sufficient to hold a Scotch pint of the
"silver soup," was lying in what had been used as a
coal-bunker. Meanwhile, Reid hurried in in great dejection,
because the milk-woman had baffled him by
going into a house in one of the wynds, and emerging
by the back, and escaping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's provided for," said the officer, "and you may
go. I don't need you here; but you may go to Wardrop's
Court, top of stair, and help Jones to take care
of Four-toes and George Anderson called Squint; you
know him?"</p>

<p>"Who that has once seen him will ever forget him?"
replied the other. "When will Jones be there?"</p>

<p>"Just when you will arrive, giving you time to walk
slow, like a good detective."</p>

<p>"And now," said our officer, as he proceeded to
fasten up the door, "so much for a casual question,&mdash;a
good night's work, and a reward of a hundred for
recovering a thousand. I think I am entitled to my
breakfast. It's not often a man makes so much of a
morning." And resuming his deliberate walk&mdash;a characteristic,
as he himself acknowledged, of a true thief-catcher&mdash;he
repaired to a coffee-house in Nicolson
Street, and allayed his hunger by coffee and a pound
of chops. It was about ten o'clock when he reached
the office, where he had the pleasant scene presented
to him of a well-assorted bag of game&mdash;the last victims,
Four-toes and Squint, being in the act of being deposited
as he entered. The principals secure, the accessories
were of less consequence. There were there Abram,
Slabberdash, Squint, and Four-toes.</p>

<p>"To complete our complement we must have Four-toes'
mother and Mrs. Anderson," he said to the superintendent,
"and Reid and Jones will go and fetch
them."</p>

<p>In the course of an hour both these ladies were
brought into the already considerable company. That
they were all surprised at the unexpected meeting, belongs
to reasonable conjecture; and that Christian
Anderson was more surprised than any of them, when
she discovered her mistake in trusting her secrets to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the "ill-looking scoundrel" of a detective in place
of Abram, is not less reasonable. Our officer was,
in truth, too gallant a man to traverse those laws
of etiquette which demand respect for the feelings of
females, and he never once alluded to the <i>contretemps</i>.
But Chirsty did not feel the same delicacy in regard to
him, who she feared would hang her for misplaced
confidence. She had no sooner recovered from her
surprise than she cried out to him, in a shrill, piercing
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you'll hae mercy on me, sir. It wad do ye
nae guid to stretch the wizzened craig o' an auld woman,
because some silly words&mdash;I wish they had choket me&mdash;cam
oot o't."</p>

<p>"They will never be brought against you," said he;
"make yourself easy on that score."</p>

<p>"Then what am I here for?" she growled, as, relieved
somewhat from her fear, she got into her natural temper.</p>

<p>"For agreeing to hide stolen property."</p>

<p>"Stolen property!" she replied. "And did ye no
steal from me my secret about my puir laddie, that ye
may string him to a wuddy? There's an auld sayin'
that speech is silvern, but silence is gowden. Whaur
is the difference between stealing frae me the siller o'
my speech, and robbing a man o' the siller o' his jugs
and teaspoons?"</p>

<p>"Quiet," he said calmly. "Abram, I want to speak
with you. Separate these," he added, addressing one
of the men.</p>

<p>And having got Abram by himself, he asked him if
he was inclined to run the risk of a trial and condemnation,
or tell the truth, and trust to the Royal mercy.
The Jew hesitated; but our officer knew that a hesitating
criminal is like a hesitating woman&mdash;each waits for
an argument to resolve them against their faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
honour. He knew that misfortune breaks up the bonds
of etiquette, even among the virtuous; and that the
honour among themselves, of which thieves boast, and
a portion of mankind, for some strange reason, secretly
approve, becomes weak in proportion to the danger of
retributive justice. Not much given to speculate, he
yet sometimes wondered why it was that one should be
despised and treated harshly because he comes forward
to serve the ends of justice and benefit society; but a
less acute mind may feel no difficulty in accounting for
the anomaly. The king's-evidence, while he proves
himself a coward and false to his faith, acts from pure
selfishness; and though he offers a boon to society, it is
in reality a bargain which he drives for self-preservation.
These speculations certainly did not pass through
the mind of Abram, if his prevailing thought was not
more likely in the form&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I can't get my pound of silver out of the Christian,
I can at least keep my own pound of flesh."</p>

<p>But whether he thought in this Jewish form or not,
it is certain that he was not long in making as clean a
breast as a Jew might be expected to make of the
whole secret of the robbery. It was planned and
executed, he said, by Slabberdash and Squint, and he
agreed to become resetter on the condition of being
allowed to retain a half of the proceeds. Four-toes
brought the plate to him at half a dozen courses of her
pitchers, and he had intended on that very day to melt
all that was meltable. The watches and rings were to
be reserved for opportunities, as occasions presented.</p>

<p>I give this story by way of an example of those
strange workings in a close society, whereby often
great events are discovered from what is termed
chance. Such occurrences, however they may startle
us, are all explainable by the laws of probabilities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
They occur often just in proportion to the increase of
ramifications in civilised conditions. More people come
into the plot; the increased activity drives the culprits
to shifts, and these shifts are perilous from the very
circumstance of being forced. We thus find detection
often more easy and certain in populous towns, with a
good staff of criminal officers, than in quieter places,
where both plotters and shifts are proportionally fewer.
If nature is always true to her purpose, so art, which
is second nature, is equally true to hers, and man is
better provided for than he deserves. I do not concern
myself with the vulgar subject of punishments, never
very agreeable to polite minds, and not at all times
useful to those who gloat over descriptions of them.
It is enough to say that the law was justly applied.
Two got clear off&mdash;the mothers of Squint and Four-toes;
and I may add that Chirsty Anderson probably
afterwards acted up more to her own proverb, that
"speech is silvern, but silence is golden."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_MERCHANTS_DAUGHTER" id="THE_MERCHANTS_DAUGHTER"></a>THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER.</h2>


<p>On the western skirts of the Torwood&mdash;famous in
Scottish story for its association with the names of
Wallace and Bruce&mdash;there stood, in the middle of the
sixteenth century, a farm-house of rather superior appearance
for the period.</p>

<p>This house was occupied at the time of which we speak
by a person of the name of Henderson, who farmed a
pretty extensive tract of land in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Henderson was a respectable man; and although not
affluent, was in tolerably easy circumstances.</p>

<p>The night on which our story opens, which was in the
September of the year 1530, was a remarkably wild and
stormy one. The ancient oaks of the Torwood were bending
and groaning beneath the pressure of the storm; and,
ever and anon, large portions of the dark forest were
rendered visible, and a wild light thrown into its deepest
recesses by the flashing lightning.</p>

<p>The night, too, was pitch-dark; and, to add to its
dismal character, a heavy drenching rain, borne on the
furious blast, deluged the earth, and beat with violence
on all opposing objects.</p>

<p>"A terrible night this, goodwife," said Henderson to
his helpmate, as he double-barred the outer door, while
she stood behind him with a candle to afford him the
necessary light to perform this operation.</p>

<p>"I wish these streamers that have been dancing all
night in the north may not bode some ill to poor Scotland.
They were seen, I mind, just as they are now,
eight nights precisely before that cursed battle of Flod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>den;
and it was well judged by them that some serious
disaster was at hand."</p>

<p>"But I have heard you say, goodman," replied David
Henderson's better-half, who&mdash;the former finding some
difficulty in thrusting a bar into its place&mdash;was still detained
in her situation of candle-holder, "that the fight
of Flodden was lost by the king's descending from his
vantage-ground."</p>

<p>"True, goodwife," said David; "but was not his
doing so but a means of fulfilling the prognostication?
How could it have been brought about else?"</p>

<p>The door being now secured, Henderson and his
wife returned without further colloquy into the house;
and shortly after, it being now late, retired to bed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the storm continued to rage with
unabated violence. The rush of the wind amongst the
trees was deafening; and at first faintly, but gradually
waxing louder, as the stream swelled with the descending
deluge of rain, came the hoarse voice of the adjoining
river on the blast as it boiled and raged along.</p>

<p>Henderson had been in bed about an hour&mdash;it was
now midnight&mdash;but had been kept awake by the tremendous
sounds of the tempest, when, gently jogging
his slumbering helpmate&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goodwife," he said, "listen a moment. Don't you
hear the voice of some one shouting without?"</p>

<p>They now both listened intently; and loudly as the
storm roared, soon distinguished the tramp of horses'
feet approaching the house.</p>

<p>In the next moment, a rapid succession of thundering
strokes on the door, as if from the butt end of a
heavy whip, accompanied by the exclamations of&mdash;"Ho!
within there! house, house!" gave intimation
that the rider sought admittance.</p>

<p>"Who can this be?" said Henderson, making an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
attempt to rise; in which, however, he was resisted by
his wife, who held him back, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind them, David; let them just rap on.
This is no time to admit visitors. Who can tell who
they may be?"</p>

<p>"And who cares who they may be?" replied the
sturdy farmer, throwing himself out of bed. "I'll just
see how they look from the window, Mary;" and he
proceeded to the window, threw it up, looked over, and
saw beneath him a man of large stature, mounted on a
powerful black horse, with a lady seated behind him.</p>

<p>"Dreadful night, friend," said the stranger, looking
up to the window occupied by Henderson, and to which
he had been attracted by the noise made in raising it.
"Can you give my fellow-traveller here shelter till
the morning? She is so benumbed with cold, so
drenched with wet, and so exhausted by the fatigue
of a long day's ride, that she can proceed no further;
and we have yet a good fifteen miles to make out."</p>

<p>"This is no hostel, friend, for the accommodation of
travellers," replied the farmer. "I am not in the
habit of admitting strangers into my house, especially
at so late an hour of the night as this."</p>

<p>"Had I been asking for myself," rejoined the horseman,
"I should not have complained of your wariness;
but surely you won't be so churlish as refuse quarters
to a lady on such a night as this. She can scarce retain
her seat on the saddle. Besides, you shall be
handsomely paid for any trouble you may be put to."</p>

<p>"Oh do, good sir, allow me to remain with you for
the night, for I am indeed very much fatigued," came
up to the ear of Henderson, in feeble but silvery tones,
from the fair companion of the horseman, with the addition,
after a short pause, of "You shall be well rewarded
for the kindness."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>At a loss what to do, Henderson made no immediate
reply, but, scratching his head, withdrew from the
window a moment to consult his wife.</p>

<p>Learning that there was a lady in the case, and judging
from this circumstance that no violence or mischief
of any kind was likely to be intended, the latter agreed,
although still with some reluctance, to her husband's
suggestion that the benighted travellers should be admitted.</p>

<p>On this resolution being come to, Henderson returned
to the window, and thrusting out his head,
exclaimed, "Wait there a moment, and I will admit
you."</p>

<p>In the next instant he had unbarred the outer door,
and had stepped out to assist the lady in dismounting;
but was anticipated in this courtesy by her companion,
who had already placed her on the ground.</p>

<p>"Shall I put up your horse, sir?" said Henderson,
addressing the stranger, but now with more deference
than before; as, from his dress and manner, which he
had now an opportunity of observing more closely, he
had no doubt he was a man of rank.</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you, friend," replied the latter.
"My business is pressing, and I must go on; but allow
me to recommend this fair lady to your kindest attention.
To-morrow I will return and carry her away."</p>

<p>Saying this, he again threw himself on his horse&mdash;a
noble-looking charger&mdash;took bridle in hand, struck his
spurs into his side, and regardless of all obstacles, and
of the profound darkness of the night, darted off with
the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>In an instant after, both horse and rider were lost in
the gloom; but their furious career might for some
time be tracked, even after they had disappeared, by
the streams of fire which poured from the fierce colli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>sion
of the horse's hoofs with the stony road over which
he was tearing his way with such desperate velocity.</p>

<p>Henderson in the meantime had conducted his fair
charge into the house, and had consigned her to the
care of his wife, who had now risen for the purpose of
attending her.</p>

<p>A servant having been also called up, a cheerful fire
soon blazed on the hearth of the best apartment in the
house&mdash;that into which the strange lady had been
ushered.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted farmer's wife now also supplied her
fair guest with dry clothing and other necessaries, and
did everything in her power to render her as comfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>To this kindness her natural benevolence alone would
have prompted her; but an additional motive presented
itself in the youth and extreme beauty of the fair
traveller, who was, as the farmer's wife afterwards remarked
to her husband, the loveliest creature her eyes
ever beheld. Nor was her manner less captivating: it
was mild and gentle, while the sweet silvery tones of
her voice imparted an additional charm to the graces of
her person.</p>

<p>Her apparel, too, the good woman observed, was of the
richest description; and the jewellery with which she was
adorned, in the shape of rings, bracelets, etc., and which
she deposited one after another on a table that stood
beside her, with the careless manner of one accustomed
to the possession of such things, seemed of great value.</p>

<p>A purse, also, well stored with golden guineas, as the
sound indicated, was likewise thrown on the table with
the same indifferent manner.</p>

<p>The wealth of the fair stranger, in short, seemed
boundless in the eyes of her humble, unsophisticated
attendant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The comfort of the young lady attended to in every
way, including the offer of some homely refreshment,
of which, however, she scarcely partook, pleading excessive
fatigue as an apology, she was left alone in the
apartment to retire to rest when she thought proper;
the room containing a clean and neat bed, which had
always been reserved for strangers.</p>

<p>On rejoining her husband, after leaving her fair
guest, a long and earnest conversation took place between
the worthy couple as to who or what the
strangers could be. They supposed, they conjectured,
they imagined, but all to no purpose. They could
make nothing of it beyond the conviction that they
were persons of rank; for the natural politeness of the
"guidwife" had prevented her asking the young lady
any questions touching her history; and she had made
no communication whatever on the subject herself.</p>

<p>As to the lady's companion, all that Henderson, who
was the only one of the family who had seen him, could
tell, was, that he was a tall, dark man, attired as a
gentleman, but so muffled up in a large cloak, that he
could not, owing to that circumstance and the extreme
darkness of the night, make out his features
distinctly.</p>

<p>Henderson, however, expressed some surprise at the
abruptness of his departure, and still more at the wild
and desperate speed with which he had ridden away,
regardless of the darkness of the night and of all obstacles
that might be in the way.</p>

<p>It was what he himself, a good horseman, and who
knew every inch of the ground, would not have done
for a thousand merks; and a great marvel he held it,
that the reckless rider had got a hundred yards without
horse and man coming down, to the utter destruction of
both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the substance of Henderson's communications
to his wife regarding the horseman. The latter's
to him was of the youth and exceeding beauty of his fair
companion, and of her apparently prodigious wealth.
The worthy man drank in with greedy ears, and looks
of excessive wonderment, her glowing descriptions of
the sparkling jewels and heavily laden purse which she
had seen the strange lady deposit on the table; and
greatly did these descriptions add to his perplexity as
to who or what this lady could possibly be.</p>

<p>Tired of conjecturing, the worthy couple now again
retired to rest, trusting that the morning would bring
some light on a subject which so sadly puzzled them.</p>

<p>In due time that morning came, and, like many of
those mornings that succeed a night of storm, it came
fair and beautiful. The wind was laid, the rain had
ceased, and the unclouded sun poured his cheerful
light through the dark green glades of the Torwood.</p>

<p>On the same morning another sun arose, although to
shine on a more limited scene. This was the fair guest
of David Henderson of Woodlands, whose beauty, remarkable
as it had seemed on the previous night under
all disadvantages, now appeared to surpass all that can
be conceived of female perfection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson looked, and, we may say, gazed on
the fair stranger with a degree of wonder and delight,
that for some time prevented her tendering the civilities
which she came for the express purpose of offering.
For some seconds she could do nothing but obey a
species of charm, for which, perhaps, she could not
have very well accounted. The gentle smile, too,
and melodious voice of her guest, seemed still more
fascinating than on the previous evening.</p>

<p>In the meantime the day wore on, and there was yet
no appearance of the lady's companion of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
night, who, as the reader will recollect, had promised to
Henderson to return and carry away his fair lodger.</p>

<p>Night came, and still he appeared not. Another day
and another night passed away, and still he of the
black charger was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>The circumstance greatly surprised both Henderson
and his wife; but it did not surprise them more than
the lady's apparent indifference on the subject. She
indeed joined, in words at least, in the wonder which
they once or twice distantly hinted at the conduct of
the recreant knight; but it was evident that she did not
feel much of either astonishment or disappointment at
his delay.</p>

<p>Again and again, another and another day came and
passed away, and still no one appeared to inquire after
the fair inmate of Woodlands.</p>

<p>It will readily be believed that the surprise of
Henderson and his wife at this circumstance increased
with the lapse of time. It certainly did. But however
much they might be surprised, they had little
reason to complain, so far, at any rate, as their interest
was concerned, for their fair lodger paid them handsomely
for the trouble she put them to. She dealt out
the contents of her ample and well-stocked purse with
unsparing liberality, besides presenting her hostess with
several valuable jewels.</p>

<p>On this score, therefore, they had nothing to complain
of; and neither needed to care, nor did care, how
long it continued.</p>

<p>During all this time the unknown beauty continued
to maintain the most profound silence regarding her
history,&mdash;whence she had come, whither she was
going, or in what relation the person stood to her who
had brought her to Woodlands, and who now seemed
to have deserted her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>All that the most ingeniously-put queries on the
subject could elicit was, that she was an entire stranger
in that part of the country; and an assurance that the
person who brought her would return for her one day,
although there were reasons why it might be some
little time distant.</p>

<p>What these reasons were, however, she never would
give the most remote idea; and with this measure of
information were her host and hostess compelled to
remain satisfied.</p>

<p>The habits of the fair stranger, in the meantime,
were extremely retired. She would never go abroad
until towards the dusk of the evening; and when she
did, she always took the most sequestered routes; her
favourite, indeed only resort on these occasions, being
a certain little retired grove of elms, at the distance of
about a quarter of a mile from Woodlands.</p>

<p>The extreme caution the young lady observed in
all her movements when she went abroad, a good deal
surprised both Henderson and his wife; but, from a
feeling of delicacy towards their fair lodger, who had
won their esteem by her affable and amiable manners,
they avoided all remark on the subject, and would
neither themselves interfere in any way with her proceedings,
nor allow any other member of their family
to do so.</p>

<p>Thus was she permitted to go out and return whensoever
she pleased, without inquiry or remark.</p>

<p>Although, however, neither Henderson nor his wife
would allow of any one watching the motions of their
fair but mysterious lodger when she went abroad,
there is nothing to hinder us from doing this. We
shall therefore follow her to the little elm grove by
the wayside, on a certain evening two or three days
after her arrival in Woodlands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Doing this, we shall find the mysterious stranger
seated beside a clear sparkling fountain, situated a
little way within the grove, that, first forming itself
into a little pellucid lake in the midst of the greensward,
afterwards glided away down a mossy channel
bedecked with primroses.</p>

<p>All alone by this fountain sat the young lady, looking,
in her surpassing features and the exquisite symmetry
of her light and graceful form, the very nymph of the
crystal waters of the spring&mdash;the goddess of the grove.</p>

<p>As she thus sat on the evening in question&mdash;it being
now towards the dusk&mdash;the bushes, by which the fountain
was in part shut in, were suddenly and roughly
parted, and in the next moment a young man of elegant
exterior, attired in the best fashion of the period,
and leading a horse behind him by the bridle, stood
before the half-alarmed and blushing damsel.</p>

<p>The embarrassment of the lady, however, was not
much greater than that of the intruder, who appeared
to have little expected to find so fair and delicate a
creature in such a situation, or indeed to find any
one else. He himself had sought the fountain, which
he knew well, and had often visited, merely to quench
his thirst.</p>

<p>After contemplating each other for an instant with
looks of surprise and embarrassment, the stranger
doffed his bonnet with an air of great gallantry, and
apologised for his intrusion.</p>

<p>The lady, smiling and blushing, replied, that his
appearance there could be no intrusion, as the place
was free to all.</p>

<p>"True, madam," said the former, again bowing low;
"but your presence should have made it sacred, and
I should have so deemed it, had I been aware of your
being here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The only reply of the young lady to this gallant
speech, was a profound curtsey, and a smile of winning
sweetness which was natural to her.</p>

<p>Unable to withdraw himself from the fascinations of
the fair stranger, yet without any apology for remaining
longer where he was, the young man appeared for
a moment not to know precisely what he should say
or do next. At length, however, after having vainly
hinted a desire to know the young lady's name and
place of residence, his courtesy prevailed over every
other more selfish feeling, and he mounted his horse,
and, bidding the fair wood-nymph a respectful adieu,
rode off.</p>

<p>The young gallant, however, did not carry all away
with him that he brought,&mdash;he left his heart behind
him; and he had not ridden far before he found that
he had done so.</p>

<p>The surpassing beauty of the fair stranger, and the
captivating sweetness of her manner, had made an
impression upon him which was destined never to be
effaced.</p>

<p>His, in short, was one of those cases in the matter
of love, which, it is said, are laughed at in France,
doubted in England, and true only of the warm-tempered
sons and daughters of the sunny south,&mdash;love
at first sight.</p>

<p>It was so. From that hour the image of the lovely
nymph of the grove was to remain for ever enshrined
in the inmost heart of the young cavalier.</p>

<p>He had met with no encouragement to follow up the
accidental acquaintance he had made. Indeed, the
lady's reluctance to give him any information whatever
as to her name or residence, he could not but consider
as an indirect intimation that she desired no
further correspondence with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>But, recollecting the old adage, that "faint heart
never won fair lady," he resolved, although unbidden,
to seek, very soon again, the fountain in the elm grove.</p>

<p>Having brought our story to this point, we shall
retrace our steps a little way, and take note of certain
incidents that occurred in the city of Glasgow on the
day after the visit of him of the black charger at
Woodlands.</p>

<p>Early on the forenoon of that day, the Drygate, then
one of the principal streets of the city above named,
exhibited an unusual degree of stir and bustle.</p>

<p>The causeway was thronged with idlers, who were
ever and anon dashed aside, like the wave that is
thrown from the prow of a vessel, by some prancing
horseman, who made his way towards an open space
formed by the junction of three different streets.</p>

<p>At this point were mustering a band of riders, consisting
of the civil authorities of the city, together with
a number of its principal inhabitants, and other gentlemen
from the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The horsemen were all attired in their best,&mdash;hat
and feathers, long cloaks of Flemish broad-cloth, and
glittering steel-handed rapiers by their sides.</p>

<p>Having mustered to about the number of thirty,
they formed themselves into something like regular
order, and seemed now to be but awaiting the word to
march. And it was indeed so; but they were also
awaiting he who was to give it. They waited the
appearance of their leader. A shout from the populace
soon after announced his approach.</p>

<p>"The Provost! the Provost!" exclaimed a hundred
voices at once, as a man of large stature, and of a bold
and martial bearing, mounted on a "coal-black steed,"
came prancing alongst the Drygate-head, and made for
the point at which the horsemen were assembled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>On his approach, the latter doffed their hats respectfully&mdash;a
civility which was gracefully returned by him
to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p>Taking his place at the head of the cavalcade, the
Provost gave the word to march, when the whole party
moved onwards; and after cautiously footing it down
the steep and ill-paved descent of the Drygate, took,
at a slow pace, the road towards Hamilton.</p>

<p>The chief magistrate of Glasgow, who led the party
of horsemen on the present occasion, was Sir Robert
Lindsay of Dunrod,&mdash;a powerful and wealthy baron
of the neighbourhood, who had been chosen to that
appointment, as all chief magistrates were chosen in
those wild and turbulent times, on account of his ability
to protect the inhabitants from those insults and injuries
to which they were constantly liable at the hands
of unprincipled power, and from which the laws were
too feeble to shield them.</p>

<p>And to better hands than those of Sir Robert Lindsay,
who was a man of bold and determined character,
the welfare of the city and the safety of the citizens
could not have been entrusted.</p>

<p>In return for the honour conferred on him, and the
confidence reposed in him, he watched over the interests
of the city with the utmost vigilance. But it was not
to the general interest alone that he confined the benefits
of his guardianship. Individuals, also, who were
wronged, or threatened to be wronged, found in him
a ready and efficient protector, let the oppressor or
wrongdoer be whom he might.</p>

<p>Having given this brief sketch of the leader of the
cavalcade, we resume the detail of its proceedings.</p>

<p>Holding on its way in a south-easterly direction, the
party soon reached and passed Rutherglen Bridge; the
road connecting Hamilton with Glasgow being then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the south side of the Clyde. But a little way farther
had they proceeded, when the faint sound of a bugle
was heard, coming apparently from a considerable distance.</p>

<p>"There he comes at last," said Sir David Lindsay,
suddenly checking his horse to await the coming up of
his party, of which he had been riding a little way in
advance, immersed in a brown study. "There he
comes at last," he exclaimed, recalled from his reverie
by the sound of the bugle. "Look to your paces,
gentlemen, and let us show some order and regularity
as well as respect."</p>

<p>Obeying this hint, the horsemen, who had been
before jogging along in a confused and careless manner,
now drew together into a closer body; the laggards
coming forward, and those in advance holding back.</p>

<p>In this order, with the Provost at their head, the
party continued to move slowly onwards; but they
had not done so for many minutes, when they descried,
at the farther extremity of a long level reach of the
road, a numerous party of horse approaching at a
rapid, ambling pace, and seemingly straining hard to
keep up with one who rode a little way in their front.</p>

<p>The contrast between this party and the Provost's
was striking enough.</p>

<p>The latter, though exceedingly respectable and citizen-like,
was of extremely sober hue compared to the
former, in which flaunted all the gayest dresses of the
gayest courtiers of the time. Long plumes of feathers
waved and nodded in velvet bonnets, looped with gold
bands; and rich and brilliant colours, mingling with
the glitter of steel and silver, gave to the gallant cavalcade
at once an imposing and magnificent appearance.
In point of horsemanship, too, with the exception of
Sir Robert Lindsay himself, and one or two other men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of rank who had joined his party, the approaching
cavaliers greatly surpassed the worthy citizens of St.
Mungo,&mdash;coming on at a showy and dashing pace,
while the latter kept advancing with the sober, steady
gait assimilative of their character.</p>

<p>On the two parties coming within about fifty paces
of each other, Sir Robert Lindsay made a signal to his
followers to halt, while he himself rode forward, hat in
hand, towards the leader of the opposite party.</p>

<p>"Our good Sir Robert of Dunrod," said the latter,
who was no other than James V., advancing half-way
to meet the Provost, and taking him kindly and
familiarly by the hand as he spoke. "How did'st
learn of our coming?"</p>

<p>"The movements of kings are not easily kept secret,"
replied Sir Robert, evasively.</p>

<p>"By St. Bridget, it would seem not," replied James,
laughingly. "My visit to your good city, Sir Robert,
I did not mean to be a formal one, and therefore had
mentioned it only to one or two. In truth, I&mdash;I"&mdash;added
James, with some embarrassment of manner&mdash;"I
had just one particular purpose, and that of a private
nature, in view. No state matter at all, Sir Robert&mdash;nothing
of a public character. So that, to be plain
with you, Sir Robert, I could have dispensed with the
honour you have done me in bringing out these good
citizens to receive me; that being, I presume, your
purpose. Not but that I should have been most happy
to meet yourself, Sir Robert; but it was quite unnecessary
to trouble these worthy people."</p>

<p>"It was our bounden duty, your Grace," replied Sir
Robert, not at all disconcerted by this royal damper on
his loyalty. "It was our bounden duty, on learning
that your Grace was at Bothwell Castle, and that you
intended visiting our poor town of Glasgow, to acknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ledge
the favour in the best way in our power. And these
worthy gentlemen and myself could think of no better
than coming out to meet and welcome your Grace."</p>

<p>"Well, well, since it is so, Sir Robert," replied the
king, good-humouredly, "we shall take the kindness
as it is meant. Let us proceed."</p>

<p>Riding side by side, and followed by their respective
parties, James and the Provost now resumed their progress
towards Glasgow, where they shortly after arrived,
and where they were received with noisy acclamations
by the populace, whom rumour had informed of the
king's approach.</p>

<p>On reaching the city, the latter proceeded to the
Bishop's Castle,&mdash;an edifice which has long since disappeared,
but which at this time stood on or near
the site of the infirmary,&mdash;in which he intended taking
up his residence.</p>

<p>Having seen the king within the castle gates, his
citizen escort dispersed, and sought their several homes;
going off, in twos and threes, in different directions.</p>

<p>"Ken ye, Sir Robert, what has brought his Grace
here at present?" said an old wealthy merchant, who
had been one of the cavalcade that went to meet James,
and whom the Provost overtook as he was leisurely
jogging down the High Street, on his way home.</p>

<p>"Hem," ejaculated Sir Robert. "Perhaps I have
half a guess, Mr, Morton. The king visits places
on very particular sorts of errands sometimes. His
Grace didn't above half thank us for our attendance
to-day. He would rather have got somewhat more
quietly into the city; but I had reasons for desiring it
to be otherwise, so did not mind his hints about his
wish for privacy."</p>

<p>"And no doubt he had his reasons for the privacy
he hinted at," said Sir Robert's companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may swear that," replied the latter, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Heard ye ever, Mr. Morton, of a certain fair and
wealthy young lady of the name of Jessie Craig?"</p>

<p>"John Craig's daughter?" rejoined the old merchant.</p>

<p>"The same," said Sir Robert. "The prettiest girl
in Scotland, and one of the wealthiest too."</p>

<p>"Well; what if the king should have been smitten
with her beauty, having seen her accidentally in Edinburgh,
where she was lately? and what, if his visit to
Glasgow just now should be for the express purpose of
seeing this fair maiden? and what, if I should not
exactly approve of such a proceeding, seeing that the
young lady in question has, as you know, neither
father nor mother to protect her, both being dead?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Robert, and what then?" here interposed
Mr. Morton, availing himself of a pause in the former's
supposititious case.</p>

<p>"Why, then, wouldn't it be my bounden duty, worthy
sir, as Provost of this city, to act the part of guardian
towards this young maiden in such emergency, and to
see that she came by no wrong?"</p>

<p>"Truly, it would be a worthy part, Sir Robert,"
replied the old merchant; "but the king is strong, and
you may not resist him openly."</p>

<p>"Nay, that I would not attempt," replied the Provost.
"I have taken quieter and more effectual measures.
Made aware, though somewhat late, through a trusty
channel, of the king's intended visit and its purpose, I
have removed her out of the reach of danger, to where
his Grace will, I rather think, have some difficulty in
finding her."</p>

<p>"So, so. And this, then, is the true secret of the
honour which has just been conferred on us!" replied
Sir Robert's companion, with some indignation. "But
the matter is in good hands when it is in yours, Provost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
In your keeping we consider our honours and our
interests are safe. I wish you a good day, Provost."
And the interlocutors having by this time arrived at
the foot of the High Street, where four streets joined,
the old merchant took that which conducted to his residence,
Sir Robert's route lying in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>From the conversation just recorded, the reader will
at once trace a connection between Sir Robert Lindsay
of Dunrod and he of the black charger who brought to
Woodlands the fair damsel whom we left there. They
were the same; and that fair damsel was the daughter
of John Craig, late merchant of the city of Glasgow,
who left an immense fortune, of which this girl was the
sole heir.</p>

<p>In carrying the young lady to Woodlands, and leaving
her there, Sir Robert, although apparently under
the compulsion of circumstances, was acting advisedly.
He knew Henderson to be a man of excellent character
and great respectability; and in the secrecy and mystery
he observed, he sought to preclude all possibility
of his interference in the affair ever reaching the ears
of the king. What he had told to old Morton, he knew
would go no further; that person having been an intimate
friend of the young lady's father, and of course
interested in all that concerned her welfare.</p>

<p>The palace of a bishop was not very appropriate
quarters for one who came on such an errand as that
which brought James to Glasgow. But this was a circumstance
that did not give much concern to that
merry and somewhat eccentric monarch; and the less
so, that the bishop himself happened to be from home
at the time, on a visit to his brother of St. Andrews.</p>

<p>Having the house thus to himself, James did not
hesitate to make as free use of it as if he had been at
Holyrood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not many hours after his arrival at the castle,
that he summoned to his presence a certain trusty attendant
of the name of William Buchanan, and thus
schooled him in the duties of a particular mission in
which he desired his services.</p>

<p>"Willie," said the good-humoured monarch, "at the
further end of the Rottenrow of this good city of Glasgow&mdash;that
is, at the western end of the said row&mdash;there
stands a fair mansion on the edge of the brae, and overlooking
the strath of the Clyde. It is the residence of
a certain fair young lady of the name of Craig. Now,
Willie, what I desire of you to do is this: you will go
to this young lady from me, carrying her this gold ring,
and say to her that I intend, with her permission,
doing myself the honour of paying her a visit in the
course of this afternoon.</p>

<p>"Make your observations, Willie, and let me know
how the land lies when you return. But, pray thee,
keep out of the way of our worthy knight of Dunrod;
and if thou shouldst chance to meet him, and he should
question thee, seeing that you wear our livery, breathe
no syllable of what thou art about, otherwise he may
prove somewhat troublesome to both of us. At any
rate, to a certainty, he would crop thy ears, Willie;
and thou knowest, king though I be, I could not put
them on again, nor give thee another pair in their stead.
So keep those thou hast out of the hands of Sir Robert
Lindsay of Dunrod, I pray thee."</p>

<p>Charged with his mission, Willie, who had been often
employed on matters of this kind before, proceeded to
the street with the unsavoury name already mentioned;
but, not knowing exactly where to find the house he
wanted, he looked around him to see if he could see
any one to whom he might apply for information.
There happened to be nobody on the street at the time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
but his eye at length fell on an old weaver&mdash;as, from
the short green apron he wore, he appeared to be&mdash;standing
at a door.</p>

<p>Towards this person Willie now advanced, discarding,
however, as much as possible, all appearance of having
any particular object in view; for he prided himself on
the caution and dexterity with which he managed all
such matters as that he was now engaged in.</p>

<p>"Fine day, honest man," said Willie, approaching
the old weaver. "Gran wather for the hairst."</p>

<p>"It's just that, noo," replied the old man, gazing at
Willie with a look of inquiry. "Just uncommon pleesant
wather."</p>

<p>"A bit nice airy place up here," remarked the latter.</p>

<p>"Ou ay, weel aneuch for that," replied the weaver.
"But air 'll no fill the wame."</p>

<p>"No very substantially," said Willie. "Some gran
hooses up here, though. Wha's is that?" and he
pointed to a very handsome mansion-house opposite.</p>

<p>"That's the rector o' Hamilton's," replied the weaver.</p>

<p>"And that are there?"</p>

<p>"That's the rector o' Carstairs'."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"That's the rector o' Erskine's."</p>

<p>"'Od, but ye do leeve in a godly neighbourhood
here," said Willie, impatient with these clerical iterations.
"Do a' the best houses hereawa belang to the
clergy?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, the maist feck o' them," said the weaver.
"Leave ye them alane for that. The best o' everything
fa's to their share."</p>

<p>"Yonder's anither handsome hoose, noo," said Willie,
pointing to one he had not yet indicated. "Does yon
belang to the clergy too?"</p>

<p>"Ou no; yon's the late Mr. Craig's," replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
weaver; "ane o' oor walthiest merchants, wha died
some time ago."</p>

<p>"Ou ay," said Willie, drily; "just sae. Gude
mornin', friend." And thinking he had managed his
inquiries very dexterously, he sauntered slowly away&mdash;still
assuming to have no special object in view&mdash;towards
the particular house just spoken of, and which,
we need not say, was precisely the one he wanted.</p>

<p>It was a large isolated building, with an extensive
garden behind, and stretching down the face of what is
now called the Deanside Brae. On the side next the
street, the entrance was by a tall, narrow, iron gate.
This gate Willie now approached, but found it locked
hard and fast. Finding this, he bawled out, at the top
of his voice, for some one to come to him. After a
time, an old woman made her appearance, and, in no
very pleasant mood, asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p>"I hae a particular message, frae a very particular
person, to the young leddy o' this hoose," replied Willie.</p>

<p>"Ye maun gang and seek the young leddy o' this
hoose ither whars than here, then," said the old dame,
making back to the house again, without intending any
further communication on the subject.</p>

<p>"Do ye mean to say that she's no in the hoose?"
shouted Willie.</p>

<p>"Ay, I mean to say that, and mair too," replied the
old crone. "She hasna been in't for a gey while, and
winna be in't for a guid while langer; and sae ye may
tell them that sent ye."</p>

<p>Saying this, she passed into the house; and by doing
so, would have put an end to all further conference.</p>

<p>But Willie was not to be thus baffled in his object.
Changing his tactics from the imperative to the wheedling,
in which last he believed himself to be exceedingly
dexterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mistress&mdash;I say, Mistress," he shouted, in a loud,
but coaxing tone; "speak a word, woman&mdash;just a
word or two. Ye maybe winna fare the waur o't."</p>

<p>Whether it was the hint conveyed in the last clause
of Willie's address, or that the old woman felt some
curiosity to hear what so urgent a visitor had to say,
she returned to the door, where, standing fast, and looking
across the courtyard at Willie, whose sly though
simple-looking face was pressed against the iron bars
of the outer gate, she replied to him with a&mdash;</p>

<p>"Weel, man, what is't ye want?"</p>

<p>"Tuts, woman, come across&mdash;come across," said
Willie, wagging her towards him with his forefinger.
"I canna be roarin' out what I hae to say to ye a' that
distance. I micht as weel cry it oot at the cross. See,
there's something to bring ye a wee nearer."</p>

<p>And he held out several small silver coin through
the bars of the gate. The production of the cash had
the desired effect. The old woman, who was lame, and
who walked by the aid of a short thick stick with a
crooked head, hobbled towards him, and, having
accepted the proffered coin, again asked, though
with much more civility than before, what it was he
wanted?</p>

<p>"Tuts, woman, open the yett," said Willie in his
cagiest manner, "and I'll tell ye a' aboot it. It's
hardly ceevil to be keeping a body speakin' this way
wi' his nose thrust through atwixt twa cauld bars o'
airn, like a rattin atween a pair o' tangs."</p>

<p>"Some folks are safest that way, though," replied
the old woman, with something like an attempt at a
laugh. "Bars o' airn are amang the best freens we
hae sometimes. But as ye seem a civil sort o' a chiel,
after a', I'll let ye in, although I dinna see what ye'll
be the better o' that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, she took a large iron key from her girdle,
inserted it in the lock, and in the next moment the
gate grated on its hinges; yielding partly to the pressure
of Willie from without, and partly to the co-operative
efforts of the old woman from within.</p>

<p>"Noo," said Willie, on gaining the interior of the
courtyard&mdash;"Noo," he said, affecting his most coaxing
manner, "you and me 'll hae a bit crack thegither,
guidwife."</p>

<p>And, sitting down on a stone bench that ran along
the front of the house, he motioned to the old lady to
take a seat beside him, which she did.</p>

<p>"I understand, guidwife," began Willie, who meant
to be very cunning in his mode of procedure, "that
she's just an uncommon bonny leddy your mistress;
just wonderfu'."</p>

<p>"Whaever tell't ye that, didna misinform ye," replied
the old woman drily.</p>

<p>"And has mints o' siller?" rejoined Mr. Buchanan.</p>

<p>"No ill aff in that way either," said the old woman.</p>

<p>"But it's her beauty&mdash;it's her extraordinary beauty&mdash;that's
the wonder, and that I hear everybody speakin'
aboot," said Willie. "I wad gie the price o' sax fat
hens to see her. Could ye no get me a glisk o' her ony
way, just for ae minute?"</p>

<p>"Didna I tell ye before that she's no at hame?" said
the old dame, threatening again to get restive on Willie's
hands.</p>

<p>"Od, so ye did; I forgot," said Mr. Buchanan,
affecting obliviousness of the fact. "Whaur may she
be noo?" he added in his simplest and <i>couthiest</i>
manner.</p>

<p>"Wad ye like to ken?" replied the old lady with a
satirical sneer.</p>

<p>"'Deed wad I; and there's mae than me wad like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
ken," replied Willie; "and them that wad pay handsomely
for the information."</p>

<p>"Really," said the old dame, with a continuation of the
same sneer, and long ere this guessing what Willie was
driving at. "And wha may they be noo, if I may speer?"</p>

<p>"They're gey kenspeckled," replied Mr. Buchanan;
"but that doesna matter. If ye canna, or winna tell
me whaur Mistress Craig is, could ye no gie's a bit inklin'
o' whan ye expect her hame?"</p>

<p>"No; but I'll gie ye a bit inklin o' whan ye'll walk
oot o' this," said the old woman, rising angrily from
her seat; "and that's this minute, or I'll set the dug on
ye. Hisk, hisk&mdash;Teeger, Teeger!"</p>

<p>And a huge black dog came bouncing out of the
house, and took up a position right in front of Willie;
wagging his tail, as if in anticipation of a handsome
treat in the way of worrying that worthy.</p>

<p>"Gude sake, woman," said Willie, rising in great
alarm from his seat, and edging towards the outer gate&mdash;"What's
a' this for? Ye wadna set that brute on
a Christian cratur, wad ye?"</p>

<p>"Wadna I? Ye'd better no try me, frien', but troop
aff wi' ye. Teeger," she added, with a significant look.
The dog understood it, and, springing on Willie, seized
him by one of the skirts of his coat, which, with one
powerful tug, he at once separated from the body.</p>

<p>Pressed closely upon by both the dog and his mistress,
Willie keeping, however, his face to the foe, now
retreated towards the gate, when, just at the moment
of his making his exit, the old lady, raising her staff,
hit him a parting blow, which, taking effect on the
bridge of his nose, immediately enlarged the dimensions
of that organ, besides drawing forth a copious stream
of claret. In the next instant the gate was shut and
locked in the sufferer's face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Confound ye, ye auld limmer," shouted Willie
furiously, and shaking his fist through the bars of the
gate as he spoke, "if I had ye here on the outside o'
the yett, as ye're in the in, if I wadna baste the auld
hide o' ye. But my name's no Willie Buchanan if I
dinna gar ye rue this job yet, some way or anither."</p>

<p>To these objurgations of the discomfited messenger
the old lady deigned no word of answer, but merely
shaking her head, and indulging in a pretty broad
smile of satisfaction, hobbled into the house, followed
by Tiger, wagging his tail, as much as to say, "I
think we've given yon fellow a fright, mistress."</p>

<p>Distracted with indignation and resentment, Willie
hastened back to the castle, and, too much excited to
think of his outward appearance, hurried into the royal
presence with his skirtless coat and disfigured countenance,
which he had by no means improved by sundry
wipes with the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>On Willie making his appearance in this guise, the
merry monarch looked at him for an instant in silent
amazement, then burst into an incontrollable fit of
laughter, which the grave, serious look of Willie
showed he by no means relished. There was even a
slight expression of resentment in the manner in which
the maltreated messenger bore the merry reception of
his light-hearted master.</p>

<p>"Willie, man," at length said James, when his mirth
had somewhat subsided, "what's this has happened
thee? Where gottest thou that enormous nose, man?"</p>

<p>"Feth, your Majesty, it may be a joke to you, but
it's unco little o' ane to me," replied Willie, whose confidential
duties and familiar intercourse with his royal
master had led him to assume a freedom of speech
which was permitted to no other, and which no other
would have dared to attempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hae gotten sic a worryin' the day," he continued,
"as I never got in my life before. Between dugs and
auld wives, I hae had a bonny time o't. Worried by
the tane and smashed by the tither, as my nose and my
coat-tails bear witness."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Willie. What does all this
mean?" exclaimed James, again laughing.</p>

<p>Willie told his story, finishing with the information
that the bird was flown&mdash;meaning Jessie Craig. "Aff
and awa, naebody kens, or'll tell whaur."</p>

<p>"Off&mdash;away!" exclaimed the king, with an air of
mingled disappointment and surprise. "Very odd,"
he added, musingly; "and most particularly unlucky.
But we shall wait on a day or two, and she will probably
reappear in that time; or we may find out where
she has gone to."</p>

<p>On the day following that on which the incidents
just related occurred, the curiosity of the good people
in the neighbourhood of the late Mr. Craig's house in
Rottenrow was a good deal excited by seeing a person
in the dress of a gentleman hovering about the residence
just alluded to.</p>

<p>Anon he would walk to and fro in front of the house,
looking earnestly towards the windows. Now he would
descend the Deanside Brae, and do the same by those
behind. Again he would return to the front of the
mansion, and taking up his station on the opposite side
of the street, would resume his scrutiny of the windows.</p>

<p>The stranger was thus employed, when he was startled
by the appearance of some one advancing towards him,
whom, it was evident, he would fain have avoided if he
could. But it was too late. There was no escape. So,
assuming an air of as much composure and indifference
as he could, he awaited the approach of the unwelcome
intruder. This person was Sir Robert Lindsay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming up to the stranger with a respectful air, and
with an expression of countenance as free from all
consciousness as that which had been assumed by the
former&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope your Grace is well?" he said, bowing profoundly
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Provost&mdash;thank you," replied James;
for we need hardly say it was he.</p>

<p>"Your Grace has doubtless come hither," said the
former gravely, "to enjoy the delightful view which
this eminence commands?"</p>

<p>"The precise purpose, Sir Robert," replied James,
recovering a little from the embarrassment which, after
all his efforts, he could not entirely conceal. "The
view is truly a fine one, Provost," continued the king.
"I had no idea that your good city could boast of
anything so fair in the way of landscape. Our city
of Edinburgh hath more romantic points about it;
but for calm and tranquil beauty, methinks it hath
nothing superior to the scene commanded by this
eminence."</p>

<p>"There are some particular localities on the ridge of
the hill here, however," said Sir Robert, "that exhibit
the landscape to much better advantage than others,
and to which, taking it for granted that your Grace is
not over-familiar with the ground, it will afford me
much pleasure to conduct you."</p>

<p>"Ah! thank you, good Sir Robert&mdash;thank you,"
replied James. "But some other day, if you please.
The little spare time I had on my hands is about exhausted,
so that I must return to the castle. I have,
as you know, Sir Robert, to give audience to some of
your worthy councillors, who intend honouring me with
a visit.</p>

<p>"Amongst the number I will expect to see yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Sir Robert." And James, after politely returning the
loyal obeisance of the Provost, hurried away towards
the castle.</p>

<p>On his departure, the latter stood for a moment, and
looked after him with a smile of peculiar intelligence;
then muttered, as he also left the spot&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well do I know what it was brought your Grace
to this quarter of the town; and knowing this, I know
it was for anything but the sake of its view. Fair
maidens have more attractions in your eyes than all the
views between this and John o'Groat's. But I have
taken care that your pursuit in the present instance
will avail thee little." And the good Provost went on
his way.</p>

<p>For eight entire days after this did James wait in
Glasgow for the return of Jessie Craig; but he waited
in vain. Neither in that time could he learn anything
whatever of the place of her sojournment. His patience
at length exhausted, he determined on giving up the pursuit
for the time at any rate, and on quitting the city.</p>

<p>The king, as elsewhere casually mentioned, had
come last from Bothwell Castle. It was now his
intention to proceed to Stirling, where he proposed
stopping for two or three weeks; thence to Linlithgow,
and thereafter returning to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The purpose of James to make this round having
reached the ears of a certain Sir James Crawford of
Netherton, whose house and estate lay about half-way
between Glasgow and Stirling, that gentleman sent a
respectful message to James, through Sir Robert
Lindsay, to the effect that he would feel much gratified
if his Grace would deign to honour his poor
house of Netherton with a visit in passing, and accept
for himself and followers such refreshment as he could
put before them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>To this message James returned a gracious answer,
saying that he would have much pleasure in accepting
the invitation so kindly sent him, and naming the day
and hour when he would put the inviter's hospitality to
the test.</p>

<p>Faithful to his promise, the king and his retinue,
amongst whom was now Sir Robert Lindsay, who had
been included in the invitation, presented themselves at
Netherton gate about noon on the day that had been
named.</p>

<p>They were received with all honour by the proprietor,
a young man of prepossessing appearance, graceful
manners, and frank address.</p>

<p>On the king and gentlemen of his train entering the
house, they were ushered into a large banqueting hall,
where was an ample table spread with the choicest
edibles, and glittering with the silver goblets and
flagons that stood around it in thick array. Everything,
in short, betokened at once the loyalty and great
wealth of the royal party's entertainer.</p>

<p>The king and his followers having taken their places
at table, the fullest measure of justice was quickly done
to the good things with which it was spread. James
was in high spirits, and talked and rattled away with as
much glee and as entire an absence of all kingly reserve
as the humblest good fellow in his train.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the affability of the king, and catching
his humour, the whole party gave way to the most
unrestrained mirth. The joke and the jest went merrily
round with the wine flagon; and he was for a
time the best man who could start the most jocund
theme.</p>

<p>It was while this spirit prevailed that Sir Robert
Lindsay, after making a private signal to Sir James
Crawford, which had the effect of causing him to quit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the apartment on pretence of looking for something he
wanted, addressing the king, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I take the liberty of asking your Grace if you
have seen any particularly fair maidens in the course
of your present peregrinations? I know your Grace
has a good taste in these matters."</p>

<p>James coloured a little at this question and the
remark which accompanied it; but quickly regaining
his self-possession and good-humour&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Sir Robert," he said, laughingly, "I cannot say
that I have been so fortunate on the present occasion.
As to the commendation which you have been pleased
to bestow on my taste, I thank you, and am glad it
meets with your approbation."</p>

<p>"Yet, your Grace," continued Sir Robert, "excellent
judge as I know you to be of female beauty, I deem
myself, old and staid as I am, your Grace's equal,
craving your Grace's pardon; and, to prove this, will
take a bet with your Grace of a good round sum, that
you have never seen, and do not know, a more beautiful
woman than the lady of our present host."</p>

<p>"Take care, Provost," replied James. "Make no
rash bets. I know the most beautiful maiden the sun
ever shone upon. But it would be ungallant and
ungracious to make the lady of our good host the
subject of such a bet on the present occasion."</p>

<p>"But our host is absent, your Grace," replied the
Provost pertinaciously; "and neither he nor any one
else, but your Grace's friends present, need know anything
at all of the matter. Will your Grace take me
up for a thousand merks?"</p>

<p>"But suppose I should," replied James, "how is the
thing to be managed? and who is to decide?"</p>

<p>"Both points are of easy adjustment, your Grace,"
said Sir Robert. "Your Grace has only to intimate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wish to our host, when he returns, that you would feel
gratified by his introducing his lady to you; and as to
the matter of decision, I would, with your Grace's permission
and approval, put that into the hands of the
gentlemen present. Of course, nothing need be said
of the purpose of this proceeding to either host or
hostess."</p>

<p>"Well, be it so," said James, urged on by the madcaps
around him, who were delighted with the idea of
the thing. "Now then, gentlemen," he continued,
"the lady on whose beauty I stake my thousand
merks is Jessie Craig, the merchant's daughter, of
Glasgow, whom, I think, all of you have seen."</p>

<p>"Ha! my townswoman," exclaimed Sir Robert, with
every appearance of surprise. "On my word, you
have made mine a hard task of it; for a fairer maiden
than Jessie Craig may not so readily be found. Nevertheless,
I adhere to the terms of my bet."</p>

<p>The Provost had just done speaking, when Sir James
Crawford entered the apartment, and resumed his seat
at table. Shortly after he had done so, James, addressing
him, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir James, it would complete the satisfaction of
these gentlemen and myself with the hospitality you
have this day shown us, were you to afford us an
opportunity of paying our respects to your good
lady; that is, if it be perfectly convenient for and
agreeable to her."</p>

<p>"Lady Crawford will be but too proud of the
honour, your Grace," replied Sir James, rising. "She
shall attend your Grace presently."</p>

<p>Saying this, the latter again withdrew; and soon
after returned, leading a lady, over whose face hung a
long and flowing veil, into the royal presence.</p>

<p>It would require the painter's art to express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
adequately the looks of intense and eager interest
with which James and his party gazed on the veiled
beauty, as she entered the apartment and advanced
towards them. Their keen and impatient scrutiny
seemed as if it would pierce the tantalizing obstruction
that prevented them seeing those features on
whose beauty so large a sum had been staked. In
this state of annoying suspense, however, they were
not long detained. On approaching within a few
paces of the king, and at the moment Sir James
Crawford said, with a respectful obeisance, "My wife,
Lady Crawford, your Grace," she raised her veil, and
exhibited to the astonished monarch and his courtiers
a surpassingly beautiful countenance indeed; but it was
that of Jessie Craig.</p>

<p>"A trick! a trick!" exclaimed James, with merry
shout, and amidst a peal of laughter from all present,
and in which the fair cause of all this stir most cordially
joined. "A trick, a trick, Provost! a trick!"
repeated James.</p>

<p>"Nay, no trick at all, your Grace, craving your
Grace's pardon," replied the Provost gravely. "Your
Grace betted that Jessie Craig was more beautiful than
Lady Crawford. Now, is it so? I refer the matter, as
agreed upon, to the gentlemen around us."</p>

<p>"Lost! lost!" exclaimed half a dozen gallants at
once.</p>

<p>"Well, well, gentlemen, since you so decide," said
James, "I will instantly give our good Provost here an
order upon our treasurer for the sum."</p>

<p>"Nay, your Grace, not so fast. The money is as
safe in your hands as mine. Let it there remain till I
require it. When I do, I shall not fail to demand it."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," said James, when, placing his fair
hostess beside him, and after obtaining a brief explana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>tion&mdash;which
we will, in the sequel, give at more length&mdash;of
the odd circumstance of finding Jessie Craig converted
into Lady Crawford, the mirth and hilarity of
the party were resumed, and continued till pretty far in
the afternoon, when the king and his courtiers took
horse,&mdash;the former at parting having presented his
hostess with a massive gold chain which he wore
about his neck, in token of his good wishes,&mdash;and rode
off for Stirling.</p>

<p>To our tale we have now only to add the two or
three explanatory circumstances above alluded to.</p>

<p>In Sir James Crawford the reader is requested to
recognise the young man who discovered Jessie Craig,
then the unknown fair one, by the side of the fountain
in the little elm grove at Woodlands.</p>

<p>Encouraged by and acting on the adage already
quoted,&mdash;namely, that "faint heart never won fair
lady,"&mdash;he followed up his first accidental interview
with the fair fugitive from royal importunity with
an assiduity that in one short week accomplished the
wooing and winning of her.</p>

<p>While the first was in progress, Sir James was informed
by the young lady of the reasons for her
concealment. On this and the part Sir Robert
Lindsay had acted towards her being made known
to him, he lost no time in opening a communication
with that gentleman, riding repeatedly into Glasgow
himself to see him on the subject of his fair charge; at
the same time informing him of the attachment he had
formed for her, and finally obtaining his consent, or at
least approbation, to their marriage. The bet, we need
hardly add, was a concerted joke between the Provost,
Sir James, and his lady.</p>

<p>When we have added that the circumstance of Sir
Robert Lindsay's delay in returning for Jessie Craig,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
which excited so much surprise at Woodlands, was
owing to the unlooked-for prolongation of the king's
stay in Glasgow, we think we have left nothing unexplained
that stood in need of such aid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_BRIDE_OF_BELLS_TOWER" id="THE_BRIDE_OF_BELLS_TOWER"></a>THE BRIDE OF BELL'S TOWER.</h2>


<p>Some time ago I made inquiry at the editor of <i>Notes
and Queries</i> for information as to the whereabouts of
an old mansion called Bell's Tower, and whether it
was occupied by a family of the name of Bower; but
my inquiry was not attended with any success beyond
the usual production of surmises and speculations.
There was a place so called in Perthshire; but then it
never was occupied by people of that name,&mdash;the
Bowers being an old family in Angus, whose principal
messuage was Kincaldrum. Yet I cannot be mistaken
in the name, either of the house or the family, as
connected with the occurrences of the tradition, the
essentials of which have floated in my mind ever since
I heard them from one to whom they were also traditional.
Then the story has something of an antique air
about it, as may be noticed from the application of adjectives
to baptismal names, as Devil Isobel and Sweet
Marjory,&mdash;by no means a modern usage, but easily
recognised in analogues of our old poetry. We may
say, at least, that whether the Bowers were a very or
only a moderately ancient family, Bell's Tower was an
old structure&mdash;the name being applied to the mansion,
which was an addition to a peel or castle-house of
many centuries&mdash;not without its battlements and barnkin,
and all the other appurtenances of a strength, as
such places were called.</p>

<p>Had we more to do than our subject requires with
the <i>physique</i> of this mansion&mdash;and we have something;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
for what romance in the moral world is independent
of a <i>locale</i>, and of those lights and shadows that play
where men live and act all the wondrous things they
do?&mdash;we might be particular in our description; but
our narrator's shade will be sufficiently conciliated, if
we say that there was room enough, and ill-lighted
chambers enough, and sufficiently tortuous breakneck
stairs here and there, as well as those peculiar to
castles, lobbies in all conscience long enough&mdash;not
forgetting a blue parlour with some mysterious associations&mdash;to
supply elements for genius to weave the
many-coloured web of fiction. But we have a humbler
part to play; and it begins here,&mdash;that Mrs. Bower
had in the said blue parlour, a fortnight before our
incidents, told her eldest daughter, whom we are, for
the sake of the antique nomenclature&mdash;discriminative,
and therefore kindly, if also sometimes harsh&mdash;to call
Sweet Marjory, a piece of information, to her unexpected
and strange,&mdash;no other than that Isobel, her
sister, was the accepting and accepted of the rich and
chivalrous youth, Hector Ogilvy, a neighbouring laird's
son. Nor would it have appeared wonderful, if we
had known more of the inside of that heaving breast,
wherein a heart was too obedient to those magic
chords, with their minute capillaries spread over the
tympanum, that Marjory was as mute and pale as a
statue of marble. But the truth really was, that
Ogilvy had courted Marjory, and won her heart, and
Isobel&mdash;Devil Isobel&mdash;had contrived means to win him
to herself, at the expense of a sister's reputation for
all the beautiful qualities that adorn human nature.
And as all the world knows that both men and women
hate those they injure, we may be at no loss to ascertain
the feelings by which Isobel regarded Marjory.
Nor shall those who know the nature of woman have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
any difficulty in supposing that not more carefully does
nature guard in the bosom the physical organ of the
affections, than she concealed the feelings which had
for that fortnight eaten into the vital tissues of her
being.</p>

<p>How swiftly that fortnight had flown for Isobel!
how charged with heavy hours for Marjory! and to-morrow
was the eventful day. What doings in Bell's
Tower during this intervening time! what pattering of
feet along the sombre lobbies! what gossiping among
servants! what applications to the gate&mdash;comings and
goings! and the rooms, how bestrewn with clippings
of silk, and stray bits of artificial flowers! And, amidst
all the triumphing, Isobel displayed her nature in spite
of old saws and maxims, which lay upon brides conditions
of reserve and humility, held to be so becoming
in those who, as it were, occupy the place of a sacrifice;
yea, if some tears are shed, so much better is custom
obeyed. Then where could Marjory go, in the midst
of this confusion of gaiety?&mdash;where, as the poet says,
"weep her woes" in secret, and listen to the throbbings
of a broken heart? Not in her own room, in the
lower part of the castle tower, where her mother had
still the privilege of chiding her for throwing the
shadows of melancholy over a scene of happiness, and
where Isobel would force an entrance, to show her, in
the very spite of her evil nature, some bridal present
from him who was still to the deserted one the idol of
her heart. There was scarcely a refuge for grief,
where joy was impatient of check, and, like all tyrants,
would force reluctant conditions into a unanimity of
compliance; but up these castle stairs, in the second
room, there was one whom time had shut out from the
sympathies of the world, so old, as to be almost forgotten,
except by Marjory herself, who, all gentleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and love, delighted to supply vacant hearts with the
fervours of her friendship, and to ameliorate evils by
the appliances of her humanity.</p>

<p>With languid step she ascended the stair, and was
presently beside her great-grandaunt, Patricia Bower.
Twilight was dropping her wing, and the shadows were
fast collecting round the square windows, which, narrow
and grated, would scarcely at noonday let in light enough
to enliven the human eye. There, solitary and in the
gloom, sat the creature of the prior century, whose birth
could only be arrived at by going through generations
back ninety and five years before; but not gloom to her,
to whom the light of memory was as a necromancer,
arraying before the gleg eye of her spirit the images of
persons and things and circumstances of the far past,
with all the vividness of enchantment, and still even
raising again those very loves and sympathies they
elicited when they were of the passing hour. Yet the
doings in this house of Bell's Tower at the time, so far
removed from the period of the living archetypes of her
dreams, had got to her ear, where still the word marriage
was a charm, against which the dry impassable
nerve resisted in vain.</p>

<p>"I will go to this marriage, Marjory," she said, as
the maiden entered, and without appearing to notice
her distress.</p>

<p>"No, aunt," replied Marjory, as she sat down opposite
to her.</p>

<p>"And shall I not?" continued the ancient maiden,
as her eyes seemed to come forward out of the deep
sockets into which they had long sunk, and emitted an
unearthly lustre. "And shall I not? It is four times
a score of years bating five since I was at a bridal;
and when all were waiting, ay, Marjory, expecting the
young bridegroom, the door was opened, and four men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
carried in Walter Ogilvy's bleeding corpse, and laid
him in the bridal hall; for he had been stabbed by a
rival in the Craig Glen, down by there; and where
could they take the body but to Bell's Tower, where
his bride waited for him? But she did not go mad,
Sweet Marjory; no, no."</p>

<p>And as the image grew more distinct in the internal
chambers, so did the eyes shine more lustrously, like
stars peering through between grey clouds; and the
shrivelled muscles, obeying once more the excited
nerve, imparted to her almost the appearance of youth.
Gradually a humming tone essayed to take form in
words; but the wavering treble disconcerted her, till,
calming herself by some effort, she recited, in solemn
see-saw&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The guests they came from the grey mountain side,&mdash;<br />
The bride she was fair, and the bride she was fain;<br />
But where was the lover, who sought not his bride?<br />
Oh! a maid she is now, as a maid she was then;<br />
And her cheek it is pale, and her hair it is grey,<br />
Since the long long time of her bridal day."<br />
</p>

<p>The last line descended into a quavering whisper.</p>

<p>With the effusion, adopted probably from an old ditty,
and brought forth from its long-retaining chamber of
the brain by the inspiration of one of her often-returning
visions, the fervour of the tasked spirit died away,
and, reclining her head, she sat before the wondering
Marjory&mdash;who had heard, as a tale of the family, and
applicable to Patricia herself, the circumstances she had
related&mdash;as one suspended between death and life; nor
did it seem that it required more than a rude vibration
to decide to which of the two worlds she would in
a few minutes belong. Only a short time sufficed to
restore her to her ordinary composure, and, waving her
shrivelled hand, she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open the door to the bartisan, Marjory, that I may
have air, and see the moon, who, amidst all the changes
of life, is ever the same to the miserable and the happy."</p>

<p>Marjory obeyed her; and as she looked forth, the
moon was rising over the tops of the trees, as if to chase
away the envious shades, ready to follow the departure
of twilight. There was solace in her soft splendour for
the melancholy of the youthful girl, which might be
ameliorated by a turn of fortune, as well as for the
sadness of her aged friend, which was not only beyond
the influence of worldly change, but so like the forecast
gloom of the grave, as if the inexorable tyrant, long
disappointed, was already rejoicing in his victim. But
no sooner was the door casement opened, than the sound
of voices entered. Then Marjory stepped out on the bartisan,
not to listen, for her spirit was superior to artifice;
and, leaning over the bartisan, she soon recognised the
voices of Isobel and Ogilvy; nor could she escape the
words&mdash;</p>

<p>"I loved her for her own sake," said he, "before I
loved you, Isobel; and now I love her as your sister.
But I shall have no peace in my wedded life with you,
save on the condition that you love her also; for my
conscience tells me I have not done by Sweet Marjory
what is deemed according to the honour of man. You
see what your power has been, Isobel. Nor would I
have spoken thus on the very evening before our wedding,
were it not that I have heard you do not love her,
nay, that you hate her."</p>

<p>Then Marjory heard Devil Isobel reply; and she
knew by the voice that she was in anger, though she
cunningly repressed her passion.</p>

<p>"Believe them not," said Isobel. "By the pale face
of yonder moon, and all those bright stars that are
coming out one by one to add honour upon honour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
this evening, the last of my maiden life, I love sweet
Marjory Bower; and I swear by Him who made all
these heavenly orbs, that I shall love her as a sister
ought."</p>

<p>"It pleases me much to hear my Isobel speak thus,"
said Ogilvy. "And hark ye, love, I have here a valuable
locket, set with diamonds and opals&mdash;see, it contains
the grey hair of my mother; and, will I or nill I,
she will send this by me to Marjory as a love-token.
Now I want to convey it to Sweet Marjory through
you, because it will make you a party to the love-gift,
and so bind us all in a circle of affection."</p>

<p>"Give it me," cried Isobel, fixing her piercing eye
on the diamonds as they sparkled in the moonlight;
"and, on the honour of a bride, I will give it to my
sister, whom I love so dearly."</p>

<p>And Isobel continued to speak; but the movement
of the lovers as they walked prevented Marjory from
hearing more. Still she followed them with her weeping
eyes, as their figures, clearly revealed to her by
the moon, glided among the wide-standing trees of the
lawn, and at length disappeared. The moon had now
less solace for her. Her wound had been retouched
by a hand of all others calculated to irritate, even by
that of Ogilvy himself, who, she now knew, felt compunction
for the cruelty of his desertion. His regret
was too late to save her sorrow, but it was not too late
to increase that sorrow; for the words by which he
had uttered it reminded her, in their tone, of that
unctuous luxury he had so often poured into her
heart, and which, in their sincerity, were so unlike
the dissimulation of her wicked sister. With a deep-drawn
sigh she entered the bartisan casement, shut it
after her, and having spoken some kindly words to her
aunt, whom she kissed, she sought her way down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
bastle stair to her own room below. There she threw
herself upon a couch, not to seek assuagement, but
only to give rest to limbs that would scarcely support
her. Nor did the closed door keep from her ear those
notes of preparation, coming in so many shapes; for
there was, in addition to the customary rites of the
great sacrifice, to be a sumptuous feast, at which, too,
she would be expected to attend. Yet all these noisy
tokens did not keep from her mind the tones of that
remorse she had heard from the lips of Ogilvy, and
she fondled them, in her misery, as one would the
dead body of a dear friend on whose face still sat the
look of love in which he died. By-and-by she heard
once more the voice of Isobel, who had returned; and
she trembled as she expected the visit in execution of
her commission. The door opened, and there entered
her sister, with a face, as it appeared in the light of
the lamp she carried, beaming with the old exultation,
mingled with the smile of a soft deceit.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sweet Marjory," she said, as she held
out the golden trinket. "Saw you ever so lovely a
piece of workmanship? But you cannot discern its
value till you know it contains a lock of the hair of
<i>my</i> mother-in-law-to-be&mdash;Mrs. Ogilvy. That locket
was given to me even now by my Hector, the bridegroom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To give to me," sighed Marjory faintly.</p>

<p>"You lie for a false fiend," cried Devil Isobel. "He
gave it to me, and to me it belongs."</p>

<p>"You may keep it," said Marjory; "but I heard
Hector Ogilvy say to you that it was a gift from his
mother to me, and you promised to him to deliver it."</p>

<p>Isobel's lips turned white and whiter, as her eye
flared with the internal light struck out of the quivering
nerve by the brain inflamed by fury. Nor was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the detection alone that produced these effects: she
had construed Ogilvy's confession that he once loved
Marjory into an admission that the latter was still dear
to him, and she considered herself justified in her suspicion
by the tones of his regret; then there had shot
through her the pang of envy, when she heard that
there was a gift for Marjory from the mother, and
none to her. All these pent-up passions had been
quickened into expression by Marjory's gentle detection;
and as Marjory looked at her, she trembled.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry at me, Isobel," she said. "I did
not go out upon the bartisan to hear you; and as for
the gift, I do not want it."</p>

<p>But Marjory's simplicity and generosity, in place of
appeasing her passion, only gave it a turn into a forced
stifling, which suited the purpose of her dissimulation.
In an instant the evil features, which, as a moral expression,
had changed her into hideousness, gave way,
and she stood before her sister the beautiful being who
had enchanted Ogilvy out of his first and purest love.</p>

<p>"Come, Marjory," she said, as she grasped the faint
hand of the almost unresisting girl. "Come."</p>

<p>And leading her by a half-dragging effort out of the
room and along the passages, she took her to the large
hall, where servants were busy laying the long table
for the feast.</p>

<p>"There will be seventy here," she said, "and all to
do honour to me. How would <i>you</i> have liked it, Sweet
Marjory? You do not envy me, though you look so
sad? But oh! there is more honour for me. Come."
And still, with the application of something like force,
she led Marjory out by the front door towards the lawn,
where a number of men were, with the light of pine
torches, piling up fagots over layers of pitch. The
glare of the torches was thrown over the dark bastle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
house, and under the relief of the deep shadows, where
the light of the moon did not penetrate, was romantic
enough even for the taste of Isobel, whose spirit ever
panted for display. To add to the effect, the men were
jolly; for their supply of ale had been ample, and the
occasion of a marriage in the house of the Bowers warranted
a merriment which was acceptable to her for
whom all these expensive preparations were made.</p>

<p>"This is the marriage-pile, Marjory," said Isobel.
"I am not to be put upon it after the manner of
Jephthah's daughter; but it will blaze up to the sky,
and tell the gods and goddesses that there is one to be
honoured here on earth. How would <i>you</i> have liked
that honour, Marjory? But you are not envious. Come,
there is more."</p>

<p>And as she was leading Marjory away, an exclamation
from one of the men attracted their attention. On
turning round, they saw the men's faces, lighted up by
the torches, all directed to the bastle tower on which
the glare shone full and red. Their merriment was
gone, to give place to the feeling of awe; nor did a
syllable escape from their lips. The eyes of the sisters
followed those of the men, and were in like manner
riveted.</p>

<p>"It is the wraith bride o' the peel," said the old
forester. "She gaes round about and round about.
My mither saw it thirty years syne, when the laird
brought hame his leddy; and we ken he broke his leg
in coming off his horse to help her down. I have
heard her say</p>

<p>
'There's evil for the house o' Bower,<br />
When the bride gaes round the bastle tower.'"<br />
</p>

<p>"You are a lying knave," cried Isobel. "It is that old
cantrup-working witch, Patricia Bower, who should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
been burnt with tar-barrels and tormented by prickers
fifty years ago. Nor ghost, nor ghoul, nor demon or
devil, shall come between me and my happy destiny."</p>

<p>A speech which, spoken in excitement, was cheered
by all the men but the unfortunate forester; for, as we
have said, they were merry with ale. And they knew
by report, as they now saw with their eyes, the beauty
of the young woman, who, in addition to her natural
charms, appeared, as they whirled the torches round
their heads, and the cheers rose and echoed in the
woods, to be invested with the dignity of a queen.
But as this natural enthusiasm died down, they turned
again their wondering eyes to the bastle house; and as
the figure still went round the bartisan and round the
bartisan, they looked at each other, and shook their
heads with a motion which appeared very grotesque in
the glare of the torches. At length it disappeared, and
they began again to pile the fagots, now in silence, and
not with the merry words and snatches of their prior
humour, as if each of them had foreseen some evil
which he could not define.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Isobel had again seized Marjory, to continue
the round of her triumphs.</p>

<p>"We will now go to my boudoir, nor mind that
witch," she said, "and I will show you all the presents
I have got from my neighbours and friends. Oh! they
are so fine, that did I not know that you are not envious,
I would fear that you would tear my eyes out.
Oh, but look, there is Ogilvy's horse standing waiting
for him to carry him home, and I shall see him only
this once before I am made his wife." Then, pausing
and becoming meditative, she led her sister into the
shade of a gigantic elm, the stem of which sufficed to
conceal them from observers. "Kneel down," she continued
in a stern tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why so?" replied Marjory, trembling with fear,
yet obeying instinctively.</p>

<p>"Swear," cried Isobel, "that you will not, before
Ogilvy, contradict what I shall say to him about his
mother's gift. Swear."</p>

<p>"I swear," replied the sister.</p>

<p>And rising up, her hand was again grasped by Isobel,
as she led her forward to where the horse stood. Nor
had they proceeded many paces, when Ogilvy himself
was observed coming forward. He could see them by
the light of the torches, as they saw him; and upon
the instant, Isobel, clasping Marjory in her arms, kissed
her with all the fervency of love.</p>

<p>"How pleasant this is to me," said Ogilvy, as he came
up equipped and spurred for his ride, "to see you so
loving and sisterly!"</p>

<p>"Did I not swear by Dian and the stars I would love
her?" said Devil Isobel; "and is she not called Sweet
Marjory?"</p>

<p>"Sweet she is," said he, as he timidly scanned the
face of his first love, and pressed her hand; but his
countenance changed as he felt the silky-skinned hand
of the girl tremble within his, as if it shrunk from the
touch, and saw her blue eyes turned on the ground, and
heard a sigh steal from her breast. A feeling that was
new to him thrilled through the circle of his nerves, and
made him tremble to the centre of his being. He had
never calculated upon that strange emotion, nor could
he analyze it: it was inscrutable, but it was terrible;
it was not simply a return of his own love under the
restraint of the new one, neither was it simple remorse,
but a mixture of various thrills which induced no purpose,
but only rendered him uncertain, feeble, and
miserable. So engrossed for a moment was he, that
he did not even seek the eye of Isobel, who was watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ing
him in every turn of his countenance. Then he
would seek some relief in words.</p>

<p>"You have my mother's love at least, Marjory," he
said; and he could not help saying it. "And I shall
be pleased to see you wear her gift, which she sent to
you through me, who gave it to Isobel."</p>

<p>Marjory was silent, and Ogilvy turned his eye upon
Isobel.</p>

<p>"She rejects it," said Isobel, "and wishes me to
return it."</p>

<p>"Rejects it!" ejaculated the youth, as he again looked
at Marjory.</p>

<p>Marjory was still silent, and her eyes were even more
timidly turned to the ground.</p>

<p>"I did not regard the gift as valuable for the brilliants
and opals," continued he, "but as conveying the
love of my mother; and surely Marjory cannot reject
that love."</p>

<p>Yet still was Marjory silent, for she had sworn.</p>

<p>"Oh, she is frightened, poor Sweet Marjory," cried
Isobel, with a satirical laugh; "for she has seen the
wraith bride on the bastle tower."</p>

<p>"The wraith bride!" responded Ogilvy, relapsing
into silence, and instinctively looking round him, where
only glared the torchlight among the trees of the lawn,
and the dark bodies of the fagot-pilers were moving
backwards and forwards. He had heard the couplet
mentioned by the forester, and had of course viewed it
as a play of superstition; but reason is a weak thing
in the grasp of feeling, and now he was all feeling.
The remorse of which he had had premonitions, had
now taken him as a fit. His eye sought Marjory's
down-turned face, and shrunk from Isobel's watchful
stare; but the direction of that organ did not form an
index to his mind, for his fancy was, even during these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
swift instants, busy weaving the many-coloured web of
the future of his married life, and clouding it with
sombre shades; nor did the active agent hesitate to
draw materials from the past fortunes of the house of
Bell's Tower, and mix them up as things yet to be repeated.
Even the wraith bride performed her part
now, where she had feeling to help her weakness, and
set her up among realities.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture of Ogilvy's thoughts, there
came up from the mansion good Dame Bower herself,
of portly corporation, often resonant of a comfortable
laugh; and now, when flushed with the exercise of her
domestic superintendence, looking the very picture of
the joyous mother of a happy bride.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten," she said as she approached, "to
ask you to convey my thanks to Dame Ogilvy for that
beautiful locket with her hair therein&mdash;more precious,
I ween, than the diamonds and opals, though these, I'm
told, are worth five thousand good merks&mdash;which she
has so thoughtfully sent to Isobel."</p>

<p>"Isobel!" ejaculated Ogilvy, fixing his eye on the
face of his bride, where there were no blushes to reveal
the consciousness of deceit. "To Isobel!" he repeated;
"and did Isobel say this?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the mother.</p>

<p>"It is false," cried the damsel, precipitated by anger
into the terrible imputation.</p>

<p>The mother stood aghast, and Marjory held her head
away.</p>

<p>"Speak, Marjory," said Ogilvy, with lips that in an
instant had become white and parched.</p>

<p>"I have sworn," said Marjory.</p>

<p>"And dare not speak?" said Ogilvy. Then a deep
gloom spread over his face, his eye flashed with a sudden
flame. He spoke not a word more; but, vaulting into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the saddle, he drove his spurs into the side of his horse,
and rode off. As he passed the fagot-hewers, he saw
them clustered together, and heard high words among
them, with names of so potent a charm to him, that,
even in his confusion and speed, he could not drive
them from his mind. These names were, Sweet Marjory
and Devil Isobel.</p>

<p>And as if the words had entered the rowels and
made them sharper, his horse reared, and he sped on
with a whirling tumult in his brain, but yet without
uttering a word&mdash;nor even to himself did he mutter a
remark&mdash;still urging his steed, yet unconscious that
his journey's end would bring no assuagement of that
tumult, nor mean of extricating him from his strange
and perilous predicament. Nor was he aware of the
speed of his riding, or how far he had gone, till he
came to some huts in the outskirts of the Craigwood,
which bounds the domain of Bell's Tower on the west,
where he saw some cottagers assembled at a door, and
again heard words which pierced his ear&mdash;no other
than those of his own marriage. Again urged by
curiosity, he put the question,</p>

<p>"Whom do you speak of, good folks?"</p>

<p>"Sweet Marjory," said one; and another added,
"Devil Isobel."</p>

<p>Fain would he have asked more&mdash;these were not to
him more than sufficient; but pride interposed, and
fear aided pride, and away he again sped even at a
still quicker pace. Never before had he been so agitated:
fear, anger, or remorse had never ruffled the
tenor of an existence which passed amidst rural avocations
and unsophisticated pleasures,&mdash;knew nothing of
intrigue, falsehood, or dissimulation&mdash;those parasitic
plagues that follow the societies of men. The moon
that shone over his head was as placid and beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and forest and wold as quiet, as they used to be when
his mind was a reflection of the peace that was without;
but now, as he rode on and on, wild images arose
from the roused autonomy of the spirit, and seemed to
be impressed by fire,&mdash;the face of Isobel reflecting the
light of the moon, and those eyes which, looking up,
were in their own expression an adjuration similar to
that pronounced by her lips, that she would obey him,
and deliver the diamond gift to its rightful owner;
then the same eyes when, inflamed by the fire of her
wrath, she called her mother a liar, and proved her
own falsehood, while she cast off the duty of a daughter.
But through all glided the face of Sweet Marjory,
with its mildness, beneficence, and timidity; and the
eye that, quailing under her sister's tyranny, looked so
lovingly in the face of the mother, but dared not chide
him who had been false to her. He felt within him
that revolution from one feeling to its opposite, which,
when it begins in the mind, is so energetic and startling.
His love for Isobel&mdash;which had been a frenzy,
tearing him from another love which had been a sweet
dream&mdash;began to undergo the wonderful change: her
beauty faded before a moral expression which waxed
hideous, and grew up in these passing moments into a
direct contrast with the gentle loveliness of her sister,
which, coming from the heart, beamed through features
fitted to enhance it. Nor could he stop this revolution
of his sentiments, the full effect of which, aggravated
by remorse, shook his frame, as his horse bounded, and
added to the turmoil within him. Yet ever the words
came from his quivering lips&mdash;"Am I fated to be the
husband of Devil Isobel? Is Sweet Marjory destined
to bless the nuptial bed of another?" And at every
repetition he unconsciously drove the spur into the sides
of his now foaming steed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>But whither all this hot haste&mdash;whither was he
flying? To his home, where he knew that his mother
condemned his choice, though her delicacy had limited
her dissatisfaction to that strange but pregnant expression,
whereby she had sent her most valuable jewel to
her whom she valued and loved, and whom, in the
madness of fascination, he had left to sorrow, if not to
heartbreaking&mdash;perhaps death.  He felt that he behoved
to be home to make certain preparations for his
appearance on the morrow, as a bridegroom by the
side of Isobel Bower; and yet he felt that he could not
face his mother under the feelings which now ruled
him, and the very weakness of his resolution prompted
the device of tarrying by the way until she should have
gone to bed. He knew where to watch her chamber
light, and he began to draw the rein. Yet how unconscious
he was of a peculiarity of that power that had
been for some time working within him!&mdash;yea, even
remorse, who, true to her unfailing purpose, was
moulding his heart into that yearning to visit the
victim on which she insists for ever as a condition of
peace to the betrayer. He had come to the cross-road
leading eastwards; and even while muttering his purpose
of merely prolonging the period of his home-going,
he was twitching the rein to the right, so that the
obedient steed turned and carried him forward at the
old speed.  Whither now, versatile and remorseful
youth? From this eastern road there goes off, a
couple of miles forward, a rough track, leading to the
mansion he had so recently left. And it was not long
ere he reached the point of turn. Nor was he even
decided when there, that he would again draw the rein
to the right. But if he was master of his horse, he was
not master of himself: the rough track was taken, and
Ogilvy was in full swing to Bell's Tower. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
know that it is only when the act is accomplished that
one thinks of the decrees of Fate, though it is true that
the purposes of man are equally fated in their beginnings,
when reason is battling against feeling, as in
their termination. In how short time was he in the
pine wood, behind the house, where were his bane, and
perhaps his antidote, though he could not divine the
latter! And he trembled as through the trees he saw
the flitting lights, as they came and went past the
windows, indicating the joy of preparation: not for
these he looked, only for one, sombre and steady,
like Melancholy's dull eye, wherein no tear glistens.
Leaving his horse tied to a pine stem, Ogilvy was in
an instant kneeling at the low casement at the foot of
the bastle house, where glimmered that light for which
he had been so intensely looking.</p>

<p>Was it that grief, forced into an excitement foreign
to its lonely, self-indulgent nature, wooed the evening
air, to cool by the open window the fever of her slow-throbbing
veins? Certain it is at least that Marjory
Bower expected no salutation from without at that hour.</p>

<p>"Sweet Marjory, will you listen to one who once
dared to love you, and who has now sorrow at his
heart, yet Heaven's wrath will not send forth lightnings
to kill?"</p>

<p>"What terrible words are these?" replied the
maiden, as she took her hand from her brow and
looked in the direction of the open casement.</p>

<p>"Not those," replied he, "which are winged with the
hope of a bridegroom. But I am miserable! Marjory
Bower, I loved you, and you returned my love; I deserted
you, and you never even gloomed on me; and
I am now the bridegroom of your sister,&mdash;ay, your
sister, Devil Isobel! Will you give me hope if I break
off this marriage?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay," rejoined she; "that cannot be. You have
gone too far to go back with honour."</p>

<p>"Or forward with any hope of happiness," said he.
"But I will brave all your father's anger, Isobel's revenge,
and my loss of honour, if you will consent to be
mine within a year."</p>

<p>"Nay," repeated the maid with a sigh. "Out of my
unhappiness may come the happiness of others. Though
I may not live to see it, I may die in the hope that
Isobel Bower may, in your keeping, come to deserve a
name better than that terrible one she has earned, and
which just now sounded so terrible from your lips."</p>

<p>"Is she not a liar, who falsified my words?" said he
impassionedly. "Is she not a thief, who appropriated
the diamond gift of my mother, intended for you? Is
she not an undutiful daughter, who first deceived her
mother by a falsehood, and then denounced her as herself
false? Is that woman, with the form of an angel
and the heart of a devil, to be my wife? And does
Marjory Bower counsel it? Then Marjory Bower hates
Hector Ogilvy!"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied she calmly, "I only love your
honour. Night and day I will pray for a blessing on
your marriage, and that God, who made the heart of
my sister, may change it into love and goodness."</p>

<p>A repressed spasmodic laugh shook the frame of
the youth. "What a hope," he said, "on which to
found the happiness of a life, and for which to barter
such a creature as you! But, Marjory, you have
roused the pride of my honour, while you have
appeased my remorse; and I will marry Isobel because
you have said that I should. It is thus I shall punish
myself by becoming a victim in turn to the honour I
was false to."</p>

<p>As he pronounced these words, he fixed his eye on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the face of Marjory, which at the moment reflected
brightly the light of the lamp. Her eyes were swimming
in tears. She seemed to struggle with herself,
as if she feared that, in thus counselling him, she incurred
some heavy responsibility. So Ogilvy thought.
But he little knew that there was mixed up with these
emotions the keen anguish of a sacrifice; for she had
not as yet admitted to him how dear he had been to her,
and how bitterly she had felt the transference of his
affections from her to her sister. He waited for a
few moments. He got no reply, except from these
swimming eyes. "Adieu! dear Marjory," he said; and
hastened again to the pine wood, where, having flung
himself on his steed, he started for home.</p>

<p>As he hurried along, he felt that he had appeased
one feeling at the expense of a life's happiness, and yet
he was satisfied, according to that law whereby the
present evil always appears the greatest. About half
way up the rough track he met one of the servants of
Bell's Tower proceeding homewards, and suspecting
that he had been with a message to him or his mother,
he stopped and questioned him.</p>

<p>"I have been to Dame Ogilvy with a letter from
Dame Bower," said the man; "and well I may," he
added, as he sided up and whispered, "The fagot-hewers
have seen the bride to-night on the top bartisan
of the castle tower."</p>

<p>"And I now see a fool," replied Ogilvy, and rode
on. Not that he thought the man the fool he called
him, but that he felt it necessary, as many men do, to
make a protest against the weakness of superstition at
the very moment when the mysterious power was busy
with his heart; and, repeating the word "fool," he
went on auguring and condemning in the double way
of mortals. How strangely he had been led for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
last hour! The terms he had heard applied to his
bride, justifying what he had himself seen, had all
but resolved him to remain absent from the intended
ceremony of the morrow. He had had some lurking
hope that Marjory would agree to his resolution, and
again inspire him with hope; and he knew that his
mother would be pleased with a change which would
yield her a chance of having her favourite for her
daughter-in-law. He had been proposing as a weak
mortal. Another power was purposing as a God; and
yet he considered himself as so much master of himself
and the occasion as to laugh with bitter scorn at the
rustic diviner, and his folly of the apparition bride.
And now there was shining before him the light of the
lamp from the chamber of his mother, whom he had
still stronger reasons than ever for avoiding that night.
But even these reasons were unavailing. The spirit of
his honour, which had been so fragile a thing when
opposed by the advent of a new love, had been breathed
upon and increased to a flame by her he had deserted;
and he for the moment felt he could face the mild
reproof of a mother whom he loved. What a versatile,
incomprehensible creature is man, even in those inspired
moments, when, with the nerve trembling under the
tension of purpose, he appears to himself and others in
his highest position! In a few minutes more he was
in the presence of his mother.</p>

<p>There sat in her painted chamber the fine gentlewoman,
with her fixed eye divining in the light of the
gilded lamp, as the spirit cast upon the dark curtain of
the future the forms which were but as re-adaptations
of the signs of what had come and gone in her memory
and experience. The two families had been linked by
the power of fate, and the connection, which had never
been dissolved; was to evolve in some new form. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
had grieved for her gentle favourite, Marjory Bower;
and had she been as stern as she was mild, she would
have interposed a parent's authority against her son's
change of purpose. Yea, there might have been true
affection in that sternness; but such would have been
the resolution of a mental strength which she did not
possess, for she was as those whose parental love gratifies
wilfulness from a fear of producing pain. Nor
even now, when she held in her hand a letter of, to her,
strange import, could she call up from her soft heart
an energy to save her son from the ruin which seemed
to impend over him. He stood for a moment before
her, silent, pale, and resolved against all chances,&mdash;verily
a puppet under the reaction of affections and
principles he had dared to tamper with against the
injunctions of honour,&mdash;and yet he could not see that
the soft and trembling hand of her in Bell's Tower,
which held the strings that bound him so, held them
and straitened them by a spasm. Nor was it of use
to him now that the strings trembled, and relaxed only
for the time when the soft, reproving, yet loving light
of his mother's eye, as it turned from her reverie, fell
upon his soul; for his purpose came again, as his lip
quivered and he waxed more pale.</p>

<p>"What means this letter?" said she, as she held it
forth in her hand. "Mrs. Bower thanks me for the
gift I sent to your bride."</p>

<p>"It means, dear mother," replied he firmly, "what
it says. I was weak enough to think that, if I committed
your jewelled locket to Isobel's hand as the
mean whereby it would reach Marjory, I would do
something to cement their love. I saw Isobel's eye
light up as she fixed it on the diamonds&mdash;their glare
had entered her soul and made it avaricious; and envy
threw her red glance to fire the passion. Yes, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
appropriated the gift. I have other evidence than
this, even from my bride." And as he pronounced
the word "bride," a scornful laugh escaped from him,
and alarmed his mother.</p>

<p>"And yet she <i>is</i> your bride, and will be your wife
to-morrow?" said she, looking inquiringly.</p>

<p>"She will," replied he, in a tone which, though soft,
if not pitiful, was firm, if a trait of sarcasm against
himself might not have been detected in it.</p>

<p>"Strange!" ejaculated the mother, as she still fixed
her eyes on him. Then, musing a little, "Do you
know that the bride has been seen to-night on the
bastle tower?"</p>

<p>"Superstition."</p>

<p>"An ill-used word, Hector," said she; "as if God
was not the Ruler of his own world. When we see
unnatural motives swaying men, and all working to an
event, are we not to suppose that that event shall also
be out of Nature's scheme? and that which is out of
Nature's scheme must be in God's immediate hand.
What motives impel you to wed a woman with whom
you must be miserable, and have that misery enhanced
by seeing every day her who would have rendered you
happy?"</p>

<p>"My honour pledged to the world, which must condemn
and laugh at a breach of faith, not to be justified
except at the expense of Isobel."</p>

<p>"A false reason," continued the mother. "Is there
more honour in adhering to a breach of honour than in
returning to the honour that was broken?"</p>

<p>"There is another reason, mother," said Ogilvy, as
he carried his hand over his sorrowful face.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Sweet Marjory commands me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Hector, Hector, how little you know of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
heart of woman! Know you not that in a forsaken
woman the heart has an irony even when it is breaking?
Ask her if you should wed her rival, and the
breaking heart-string will respond Yes, even as the
cord of the harp will twang when it is severed. Well
do I know Sweet Marjory, and what she must have felt
when she uttered this command. The canker has
begun, and she will die. The worm does not seek
always the withered leaf. You've heard the song that
Patricia used to sing&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'The dainty worm, it loves the tomb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gnaws, and gnaws its nightly food;</span><br />
But a daintier worm selects the bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a daintier still affects the bud.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Oh, God forgive me!" ejaculated the miserable
youth, as, holding his hand on his brow, he rushed out
of the room and sought his bed-chamber. Was there
ever such a night before the day, of all days auspicious
to mortals, of the culminating joy of human life!
Could he not find refuge in sleep, where the miserable
so often seek to escape from the vibrations of the leaping,
palpitating nerve, inflamed by the fever of life?
A half-hour's dreamy consciousness, an hour's vision of
returning images, rest and unrest, haunting scenes
woven by some secret power, so varied, so ephialtic,
so monstrous, yet all, somehow or another, however
unlike the reality, still vindicating a connection. Why
should Sweet Marjory be in the deep recesses of the
pine wood, resting by his foaming steed, with his
mother sitting and breathing hope's accents in her ear,
and ever and again calling on him in sobbing vocables
to return from his pursuit of another? He would
return. The charm of her sweet voice is felt to be
irresistible; yet it is resisted. And though he looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
back only to see her by the flaught of the lightning
that plays among the trees, his steps are forward,
where Devil Isobel charms him with a song, in comparison
of which the magic of the sirens is but the
rustle of the reed as it swerves in the blast. He
struggles, and seizes the stems of the pines to hold him
from his progress and keep him steady; and he
writhes as he finds he cannot obey the maternal appeal
to a son's love. All is still again, and there is rest,
only to be alternated by the recurring visions always
assuming new forms, changing and disappearing, flaring
up again, and then the deep breast-riding oppression,
and those hollow moans, which never can be imitated
by the waking sense, as if Nature preserved this
domain of the spirit as an evidence, in the night of the
soul, that there is another world where the limbo of
agony is not less certain than the heaven which is
simulated by sweet dreams.</p>

<p>But, <i>lucidus die&mdash;nocte inutilis</i>. As the day dawned,
and the morning sun, fresh from the east, threw in
between the chinks of the shutters the virgin beams,
Ogilvy felt the truth of the old saying, that every day
vindicates its two conditions of good and evil. There
was again a change in the versatile mind of the
romantic youth; and Honour, pinkt out in those
gaudy decorations woven by the busy spirits that
move so cunningly the springs of man's thoughts in a
conventional world, appeared before him. If Isobel
was still the Devil Isobel, Honour was a smiling angel,
even more beautiful than Sweet Marjory. Yet he was
not happy&mdash;only firm, as he confessed by that lying
power of the mind, to the strength of bonds he had
himself imposed, and yet repented of&mdash;setting necessity
as a will-power amidst the wreck and ruin of his
affections. The hour advanced, and he must superin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>duce
the happy bridegroom on the dead statue. Unsteady
and fitful even in the common actions of life&mdash;lifting
the wrong thing, and suddenly throwing it
down in the wrong place, again to snatch the right
thing at the wrong time&mdash;he was not so this morning.
Every step and manipulation was like the movement
of a machine. Composedness was a luxury to him.
Ornament after ornament, at a time when a bridegroom's
decorations were the expression of a rude
refinement, found its place with a steady, nay, affectedly
formal hand; yea, a more cool bridegroom had
never been seen in the world's history, since that
eventful morning when the hero of Bæotia put on his
lion's skin, and took up his wooden club, to marry the
fifty daughters of the king, though among these, if the
wise man is right, there must have been forty-nine
devils. As the solemn work went on, he looked again
and again into the mirror, where he saw none of the
wrinkles of care, no brow-knitting of fractiousness, no
sternness of resolute determination,&mdash;all quiet, smooth,
even mild. Ay, such a mime is man when he is a
mome, that he even smiled as he felt his pulse,&mdash;how
cool was his blood, how regular the vibrations! And
so the mummery went on: the flowered-red vest, the
braided coat of sky-blue, the cravat, the ruffles, the
wrist-bands scolloped and stiff, the indispensable ruff,
concealed behind by the long locks of auburn, so
beautiful in Isobel's eyes, that flowed over his broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>The work was finished; Ogilvy was dressed&mdash;his
body in all the colours of the arc of hope&mdash;his mind
in the dark midnight weeds of a concealed misery,
concealed even from himself. He sought the chamber
of his mother, and, taking her hand, kissed it fervently;
but could not trust himself to even a broken syllable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
speech, and his silence was sympathetic. She looked into
the face of her son, and then threw her eye solemnly over
the array of his dress. The tear stood apparent, yet her
face seemed to have borrowed his composedness, as if
she felt that the old doom still followed the house of
Ogilvy, and was inevitable, when the evil genius of the
Bowers was in the ascendant. There was no reproof
now, save that which lies in the dumb expression of
sorrow&mdash;even that reproof which, melting the obstruction
of man's egotism, finds its way to the heart, when
even scorn would be only a hardening coruscation. Yet
even this he could bear for the sake of that conventionality
which is a tyrant. Turning away his head, he again
kissed the soft hand, and hurried away.</p>

<p>As he issued from the gate and mounted his steed,
now refreshed from the rough stress of the previous
evening, the sun shone high and flaring, and the face
of the country, with its rising hills and heather-bloom,
and patches of waving corn, responded&mdash;as became it
surely on a bridal morning&mdash;to the clang of the bell in
Bell's Tower,&mdash;so like in all but the workings of the
heart to the Sabbath morning when the union is to be
between the spirit of man and the Lamb without guile.
Yet art, self-confident and pragmatic, was not to be
cajoled by the solicitations of, to it, a lying nature,
however beautiful; and Ogilvy found it convenient, if
not manly and heroic, to knit his eyebrows against the
sun. So does the Indian hurl his wooden spear against
the lightning, because he is a greater being than the
Author of the thunder. So he rode on to where the
bells rung&mdash;for was not he specially called?&mdash;the
gloom on his countenance, with which his forced determination
kept pace, increasing as he proceeded. Nor
had he ever ridden thus before. Even his steed might
have known, as he opened his nostrils, that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
something more than common in the wind's eye, accustomed
as he was to the speed of enthusiasm, or the
walk of exhaustion. He was now a solemn stalking-horse,
bearing a rigid, buckram-mailed showman, whose
only sound or movement resided in the plates of his
armour, or his lath sword or gilded spontoon.</p>

<p>As Ogilvy had thus enrolled himself among the
chivalry of honour, and was consequently, in his own
estimation, as we have hinted, a personage of romance,
so was it only consistent with the indispensable gloom
of his dignity and sternness that he should ride alone:
nor was it seeming that he should accost the guests
whom he saw on either side, obeying the call of the
bell, and riding along to the bridal and the feast. Yet
the scene might have enlivened somewhat a very gloomy
knight, as, looking around, he saw the lairds rounding
the bases of the hills, and heard, as others came into
sight, the sound of bagpipes, however little these might
be associated with chivalric notions and aspirations.
But then it was not easy to act this solitary part; for
what more natural than that those passing to his own
celebration should salute him? Nor could he avoid
those salutations.</p>

<p>"Joy to thee, Ogilvy," said one, as he rode up;
"the nightshade is sweeter than the rose;" and departed.</p>

<p>"A happy day," said another, "when the wolf becomes
more innocent than the lamb."</p>

<p>"Good morning, bridegroom," said a third. "The
sun shines bright, and the moss-brown tarn is more
limpid than the running rill."</p>

<p>"All happiness," said a fourth rider, "when the
merle nestles with the jolly owl, and is not afraid when
he sounds his horn."</p>

<p>But Ogilvy only compressed his lips the more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
looked the more gloomy, solacing himself with the
vision of Honour, the beautiful yet stern virgin, and
immaculate as she who shook her mailed petticoats
after getting out of Jupiter's head. Nor was the inspiration
diminished as he now saw rising before him
the rugged pile of Bell's Tower, wherein the bell rang
still more lustily as the hour approached. The guests
were thronging in a multiform, many-coloured mass,
all eager for the honour of a Bower's smile. He was
soon among the midst of them, repaying neither compliment,
nor salutation, nor mute nod, with a single
sign of acknowledgment. And now he entered the
great hall, where already the invited numbers were
nearly completed. How grand the scene! What silks,
and satins, and taffetas, flowerings, braidings, and be-purflings,
and hooped inflations! what towering toupees,
built up with horse-hair and dyed hemp, stiffened with
starch! what nosegays, redolent of heather-bells, and
roses, and orange blossoms! There sat Dame Bower
herself, fat and jolly, with her ruby dewlap, looking
dignity; and Bower, the laird, great in legend. Mess
John, too, even fatter than tradition will have him&mdash;the
sleek bald head and face, where a thousand slynesses
could play together without jostling. But what
were all these, and the fairest and the proudest there,
to Isobel Bower, as, arrayed in her long white veil, she
sailed about, heedless of all decorum, showering her
triumph upon envious damsels, as if she would blight
all their fond hopes to make a rich soil for the flowering
of her own! If others sat and looked for being
looked at, and others stood for being admired, she
walked and moved for worship, as if she claimed the
peripatetic honour of the entire round of adoration.
Not that she stared for it: she was too intensely
magnetized to doubt of the jumping of the steel sparks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
to be all arranged <i>rayonnant</i>, like a horse-shoe, round
the centre of her glory. Then, as there is by the domestic
law a wearock in every nest, however speckled,
and however redolent of balm-leaves or resonant of
chirpings, where was Sweet Marjory Bower? Where
that law ought to place her, by older legends than the
date of Bower pride and power&mdash;in a corner, plainly
dressed, and trying with downcast eyes to escape observation.
But how pallid!&mdash;as if all the colours there
had vied to steal from her cheeks, not the rosy bloom&mdash;for
it never was there&mdash;-but the fresh white of the
lily, more beautiful than all the flowers of the garden;
and not the colour alone, but the light itself of the
lily's eye. Nay, it would seem that the greatest robber
of all was her sister, whose look turned upon her as if
in scorn of her humility, and in pleasure of her woe.</p>

<p>As Ogilvy entered, walking up direct and stedfastly
to the midst of the great hall, there arose the welcome
buzz, like that humming which makes musical the
sphere where comes the reigning queen of the hive.
But how soon, as the bell in the tower ceased to ring,
was all that noise hushed into a death-like silence, as
he stood without sign or movement, with his arms
crossed, and his gloomy eyes fixed on the only empty
space in that crowded assembly! Would he not look
at the bride, or salute the bride's mother, or shake
hands with the bride's father, or do any one of all those
many things which lay to his duty&mdash;far more to his
inclination&mdash;as a happy bridegroom? Not one of them.
And there he stood, as a motionless Grecian god hewn
out of veritable panthelion, with its ivory eyes, and the
mute worshippers all about. Nay, the likeness was
even more perfect; for as these worshippers, from the
very fear of reverence and the impression of awe, kept
at a distance from that centre of deity, so those guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
who were nearest to the strange man moved instinctively
away, leaving him in the middle of the charmed ring.
But even this did not move him. Then there was
business to be done. "Oh! he was only meditative."
The greatness of the occasion was the mother of a
hundred excuses. Still to all it was oppressive, killing
enthusiasm, and so unlike what these gay hopefuls had
prefigured of that celestial state in which they wished
themselves to be. Only Isobel seemed unchanged. She
whispered to Mess John&mdash;most unseemly; but was she
not the Devil Isobel? Ogilvy, even as a statue, was
hers, and could not get away. Then the bridesmaids
sought each other, by the clustering sympathy of their
gay wreaths and their office, and the bridesman stood
in readiness. Mess John was at the altar; and the bell
was to ring the celebrating peal after the ceremony was
ended, and the guests should fall to their knives and
forks; and the retainers on the lawn, where the fire
blazed wild to roast the ox and honour the bride,
should sit down to their marriage feast.</p>

<p>As Solemnity is the mother of Angerona, with her
finger on her lip, so here reigned now the utmost stillness
that could be enforced by heaving hearts against
the buzz of a crowd. Scarcely a sound was heard as
the altar was encircled. You might have detected a
sigh, if it had not been that every sigh was suppressed.
Even Isobel was mute, but not from any cessation of
her triumph&mdash;rather from the impression of its culmination
in possession. She stood grandly, looking around
her, in defiance of the inexorable law of down-gazing
on the ground, where brides see so much which no one
else sees. Nor had she yet expressed by a look any
wonder at the statue bridegroom, whose attitude was
still unchanged. All is eye, and ear, and throbbing
heart, when of a sudden the door of the great hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
opened, calling the eye in the direction of the screech.
Who dared? Some one more daring than common
humanity. A figure entered, in the dress of another
bride,&mdash;a tall figure, with surely nothing to be covered
by the white satin and the long lace mantilla, suspended
from the top of a wreathed head white as the
driven snows of Salmon, but bones, sheer bones. The
face could scarcely be seen for the folds of the veil:
only two eyes, with no more light in them than what
plays on the surface of untransparent things, and fixed
and immoveable as if they saw nothing. The guests
were breathless from stupefying amazement. They
beheld it pass into the middle of the hall, where, in
the space that had been deserted, it began a movement
something like dancing. Strange mutterings of
a broken-voiced song, with words about long years
having passed away, rhyming with bridal day, and so
forth, in the cauldron-kettle-and-incantation style, came
in snatches.</p>

<p>"It is that infernal old witch, Patricia Bower,"
screamed Devil Isobel.</p>

<p>And rushing forward, the impassioned creature threw
the weight of her body on the composition of bones and
satin. It fell, with a loud shrill scream from a windpipe
dried by the breath of ninety-seven years.</p>

<p>Dame Bower and Sweet Marjory rushed forward and
drew back the veil. It was the antediluvian Patricia.
She was dead. The last spark had been offered to
Hymen, and the incense canister was broken. Drops
of blood issued from her mouth and nose, and sat upon
the marble face, with still remains of the old beauty in
it which had charmed Walter Ogilvy, like dots on the
tiger lily.</p>

<p>At this moment the bell began to clang. Devil
Isobel was gone. She had hurried out the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
she knew that the spark of life had fled. Nor could
she be found. The song says&mdash;</p>

<p>
"They sought her here, they sought her there,<br />
By lochs and streams that scent the main,<br />
By forests dark, and gardens fair;<br />
But she was never seen again."<br />
</p>

<p>A trick, this last line, of some of the old legend-mongers
of the Bell's Tower minstrels, no doubt to
conceal the shame of the family; for Devil Isobel had
flown to the tower, where, having concealed herself till
the bell-ringers went away to join in the feast of the
ox, which they never tasted even after so much pulling
and hauling, she mounted to the belfry. Somehow she
had contrived to cast the bell-rope round one of the
beams by which the bell was suspended, so as to produce
no noise, and then, having made a noose of a
different kind from that she had that day been busily
twining, she suspended herself by the neck. It was
some days before she was discovered. The long white
figure, still arrayed in the marriage dress with the flowing
veil, had been observed by some of the searchers;
and then, strange enough, it was remembered that one
solitary clang of the bell had been heard after the
cessation of the ringing. That was the death-peal of
Isobel Bower. But, a year after, that same bell had
another peal to sound&mdash;no other than the celebration
of the marriage of Hector Ogilvy and Sweet Marjory.
Some say that Bell's Tower got its name from the contraction
of Isobel. Names stick after the things have
passed away. They did well at least to change the rope&mdash;<i>finis
funis</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DOCTOR_DOBBIE" id="DOCTOR_DOBBIE"></a>DOCTOR DOBBIE.</h2>


<p>The particular day in the life of the worthy disciple of
Esculapius to which we desire to direct the attention of
the reader, was raw, coldish, and drizzly in the morning,
but cleared up towards noon; and although it
never became what could be called warm (it was the
latter end of September), it turned out a very passable
sort of day on the whole&mdash;such a day as no man could
reasonably object to, unless he had some particular
purpose of his own to serve. In such case he might
perhaps have wished more rain, or probably more
sunshine, as the one or the other suited his interest;
but where no such selfish motives interfered, the day
must have been generally allowed to have been a good
one. The thermometer stood at&mdash;we forget what; and
the barometer indicated "Fair."</p>


<p>PERSONAL APPEARANCE, CHARACTER, AND PECULIARITIES
OF THE DOCTOR.</p>

<p>The doctor was a little stout man, not what could
be called corpulent, but presenting that sort of plump
appearance which gives the idea of a person's being
hard-packed, squeezed, crammed into his skin.</p>

<p>Such was the doctor, then&mdash;not positively fat, but
thick, firm, and stumpy; the latter characteristic being
considerably heightened by his always wearing a pair
of glossy Hessian boots, which, firmly encasing his little
thick legs up nearly to the knees, gave a peculiar air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
stamina and solidity to his nether person. The doctor
stood like a rock in his Hessians, and stumped along in
them&mdash;for he was excessively vain of them&mdash;as proudly
as a field-marshal, planting his little iron heels on the
flag-stones with a sharpness and decision that told of a
firm and vigorous step.</p>

<p>The doctor was no great hand at his trade; but this,
it is but fair to observe, was not his own opinion. It
was the opinion only of those who employed him, and
of the little public to whom he was known. He himself
entertained wholly different sentiments on the subject.
The doctor, in truth, was a vain, conceited little
gentleman; but, withal, a pleasant sort of person, and
very generally liked. He sung a capital song, and had
an inexhaustible fund of animal spirits.</p>

<p>One consequence of the latter circumstance was his
being much invited out amongst his friends and acquaintances.
He was, in fact, a regular guest at all
their festivities and merry-makings, and on these occasions
used to get himself fully more strongly malted
than became a gentleman of his grave profession.</p>

<p>When returning home of a night in this state, the
little doctor's little iron heels might be heard rap-rapping
on the flag-stones at a great distance in the quiet
street, for he then planted them with still more decision
and vigour than when sober; and so well known in his
neighbourhood was the sound of his footsteps, so audible
were they in the stillness of the night, and so habitually
late was he in returning home&mdash;his profession forming
an excellent excuse for this&mdash;that people, even while
sitting at their own firesides, or, it might be, in bed,
although at the height of three storeys, became aware,
the moment they heard his heels, that the doctor was
passing beneath; and the exclamations, "That's the
doctor," or "There goes the doctor," announced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
important fact to many a family circle. All unconscious,
however, of these recognitions, the doctor
stumped on his way, reflecting the while, it might
be, on the good cheer he had just been enjoying.</p>

<p>On these occasions, the doctor, while he kept the
open street, got on swimmingly; but the dark and
somewhat tortuous staircase which he had to ascend
to reach his domicile&mdash;the said domicile being on the
third flat&mdash;used to annoy him sadly. When very
much overcome, as, we grieve to say it, the doctor
very frequently was, the labour it cost him to make
out the three stairs was very serious. It was long
protracted, too; it took him an immense time; for,
conscious of his unsteady condition, he climbed slowly
and deliberately, but we cannot add quietly; for his
shuffling, kicking, and blowing, to which he frequently
added a muttered objurgation or two on missing a step,
as he struggled up the dark stair, were distinctly audible
to the whole land. By merely listening, they could
trace his whole progress with the utmost accuracy,
from the moment he entered the close, until the slam
of a door announced that the doctor was housed. They
could hear him pass along the close&mdash;they could hear
him commence his laborious ascent&mdash;they could hear
him struggling upwards, and, anon, the point of his
boot striking against a step, which he had taken more
surely than necessary&mdash;they could hear him gain the
landing-place at his own door, signified by a peculiar
shuffle, which almost seemed to express the intelligence
that a great work had been accomplished&mdash;they could
hear the doctor fumbling amongst his keys and loose
coin for his check-key, and again fumbling with this
check-key about its aperture in the door, the hitting of
the latter being a tedious and apparently most difficult
achievement&mdash;and, lastly, they could hear the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
flung to with great violence, announcing the finale of
the doctor's progress.</p>

<p>Over and above the more ordinary and obvious difficulties
attending the doctor's ascent on such occasions,
and under such circumstances as those of which we
speak, there was one of a peculiar and particularly
annoying nature. This was the difficulty he found in
discriminating his own landing-place from the others,&mdash;a
difficulty which was greatly increased by the entire
similarity of all the landing-places on the stair, the
doors in all of which were perfect counterparts of each
other, and stood exactly in the same relative positions.
This difficulty often nonplussed him sadly; but he at
length fell upon a method of overcoming it, and of
ensuring his making attempts on no door but his own.
He counted the landing-places as he gained them,
pausing a second or two on each to draw breath, and
impress its number on his memory,&mdash;one, two, three,
then out with the check-key.</p>

<p>Now this was all very well had the doctor continued
to reckon accurately; but, considering the state of
obfuscation in which he generally returned home at
night, it was very possible that he might miscount on
an occasion, and take that for three which, according
to Cocker, was only two, or that for two which, by the
same authority, was but one. This was perfectly possible,
as the sequel of our tale will sufficiently prove.
In the meantime, we proceed to other matters; and, to
make our history as complete as possible, we start anew
with&mdash;</p>


<p>THE DOCTOR'S SHOP.</p>

<p>It had not a very imposing appearance; for, to tell
a truth, the doctor's circumstances were by no means
in a palmy state. The shop, therefore, was decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
a shabby one. It was very small and very dirty, with
a little projecting bow window, the lower panes of
which were mystified with some sort of light green
substance&mdash;paint or paper, we don't know which&mdash;in
order to baffle the curiosity of the prying urchins who
used to congregate about it. Not that they were attracted
by anything in the window itself, but that it
happened to be a favourite station of the boys in the
neighbourhood,&mdash;a sort of mustering place, or place of
call, where they could at any time find each other.
The typical display in the doctor's window consisted
of a blue bottle, a pound of salts, and a serpent; the
second being made up into labelled packages of about
an ounce weight each, and built up with nice skill
against one of the panes, so as to make as much show
as possible. The serpent was a native of the Lammermoor
Hills, which a boy, who drove a buttermilk cart,
brought in one morning, and sold to the doctor for a
shilling.</p>

<p>The inside of the doctor's shop, which besides being
very dirty was very dark, had a strange, mysterious,
equivocal sort of character about it. Everything was
dingy, and greasy, and battered, and mutilated. Dirty
broken glasses stood in dark and dirty corners; rows
of dirty bottles, some without stoppers, and some with
the necks chipped off, and containing drops of black,
villanous-looking liquids, stood on dirty shelves; rows
of battered, unctuous-looking drawers, rising tier above
tier, lined one side of the shop, most of which were
handled with bits of greasy cord, the brass handles
with which they had been originally furnished having
long since disappeared, and never having been replaced.</p>

<p>What these drawers contained, no human being but
the doctor himself could tell. In truth, few of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
contained anything at all. Those that did, could be
described only as holding mysterious, dirty-looking
powders, lumps of incomprehensible substances, or
masses of desiccated vegetable matter of powerful and
most abominable flavour.</p>

<p>For all these, the doctor had, doubtless, very learned
names; but such as we have described them was their
appearance to the eye of the uninitiated.</p>

<p>To complete the charms of the doctor's medical
establishment, it was constantly pervaded by a heavy,
unearthly smell, that, we verily believe, no man but
himself could have inhaled for an hour and lived.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the unpretending and homely character
of the doctor's establishment, it boasted a sounding
name. The doctor himself called it, and so did the
signboard over the door, "The &mdash;&mdash; Medical Hall,"&mdash;a
title which the envious thought absurd enough for a
place whose proudest show was a blue bottle, a pound
of salts, and a serpent. But these people did not recollect,
or did not choose to recollect, the high pretensions
of the doctor himself. They did not advert to the
numerous degrees, honorary titles, fellowships, etc.,
which he had acquired, otherwise they would have
looked to the man, not to the shop. Probably, however,
few of them were aware of the number of these
which he boasted; but it is a fact, nevertheless, that
the doctor could, and did on particular occasions, sign
himself thus:&mdash;"David Dobbie, M.D.; E.F.; M.N.O.;
U.V.; Z.Y.X.; W.V.U.;" nor did he hesitate sometimes
to alter the letters according to the inspiration
of the happy moment.</p>

<p>Now, had the doctor's right to all these titles been
taken into account, and, so taken, been appreciated as
it ought, there would have been fewer sneers at his
Medical Hall than there was as matters stood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_INVITATION" id="THE_INVITATION"></a>THE INVITATION.</h2>


<p>In another part of this history we have stated that
the doctor, being generally liked, was much invited
out to feastings and merry-makings, and convivialities
of all sorts, from the aristocratic roast turkey and bottle
of port, to the plebeian Findhorn haddock and jug of
toddy. But all, in this way, was fish that came in the
doctor's net. Provided there was quantity&mdash;particularly
in the liquor department&mdash;he was not much
given to shying at quality. He certainly preferred
wine, but by no means turned up his nose at a tumbler.
Few men, in fact, could empty more at a sitting.</p>

<p>It was observed of the doctor, by those who knew
him intimately, that he was always in bad humour on
what he called blank days. These were days on which
he had no invitation on hand for any description of
guzzle whatever&mdash;either dinner, tea, supper, or a "just
come up and take a glass of toddy in the evening."
This seldom occurred, but it did sometimes happen;
and on these occasions the doctor's short and snappish
answers gave sufficient intimation of the provoking fact.</p>

<p>In such temper, then, and for such reason, was the
doctor in the forenoon of the particular day in his life
which we have made the subject of this paper. He
was as cross as an old drill-sergeant; and what made
him worse, the affair he had been at on the preceding
night had been a very poor one. He had been hinted
away after the third tumbler&mdash;treatment which had
driven the doctor to swear, mentally, that he would
never enter the house again. How far he would keep
this determination, it remained for another invitation
to prove.</p>

<p>In this mood, then, and at the time already alluded
to, was the doctor employed, behind his counter, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
measuring off some liquid in a graduated glass, which
he held between him and the light, and on which he
was looking very intently, as the liquid was precious,
the quantity wanted small, and the glass but faintly
marked, when a little boy entered the shop, and inquired
if Dr. Dobbie was within.</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you want?" replied the doctor
gruffly, and without taking his eye off the graduated
glass.</p>

<p>"Here's a line for ye, sir," said the boy, laying a
card on the counter.</p>

<p>"Who's it from?" roared the doctor.</p>

<p>"Frae Mr. Walkinshaw, sir," replied the boy, meekly;
"and he would like to ken whether ye can come or no."</p>

<p>"Come; oh, surely. Let me see," said the doctor.
"Come; ay, certainly," he added, his tone suddenly
dropping down to the mild and affable, and speaking
from an intuitive knowledge of the tenor of the card.
"Surely; let me see." And the doctor opened the note
and read, his eyes gloating, and his countenance dissolving
into smiles, as he did so:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;A few friends at half-past eight.
Just a haddock and a jug of toddy. Be as pointed as
you can. Won't be kept <i>very</i> late. Dear Doctor, yours
truly,</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">R. Walkinshaw</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"My compliments to Mr. Walkinshaw," said the
doctor, with a bland smile, and folding up the card
with a sort of affectionate air as he spoke, "and tell
him I will be pointed. Stop, boy," he added, on the
latter's being about to depart with his message; "stop,"
he said, running towards his till, and thence abstracting
threepence, which he put into the boy's hand, with
a&mdash;"There, my boy, take that to buy marbles." The
doctor always rewarded such messengers; but he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
so systematically, and by a rule of his own. For an
invitation to breakfast he gave a penny, thus estimating
that meal at all but the lowest possible rate; for
an invitation to dinner he gave sixpence; for one to
supper, threepence, as exemplified in the instance
above.</p>

<p>In possession of Mr. Walkinshaw's invitation, the
doctor continued in excellent spirits throughout the
remainder of the day.</p>


<p>THE GUZZLE.</p>

<p>At the height of three stories, in a respectable-looking
tenement in a certain quarter of a certain city which
shall be nameless, there resided a decent widow woman
of the name of Paton, who kept lodgers.</p>

<p>At the particular time, and on the particular occasion
at and on which we introduce the reader to Mrs. Paton's
lodging-house, there was a certain parlour in the said
house in a state of unusual tidiness. Not to say that
this parlour was not always in good order: it was; but
in the present instance, it displayed an extra degree
both of <i>redding</i>-up and of comfort.</p>

<p>An unusually large fire blazed in the polished grate,
and a couple of candles, in shining candlesticks, stood
on the bright mahogany table. On a small old-fashioned
sideboard was exhibited a goodly display of bottles
and glasses, flanked by a sugar basin, heaped up with
snowy bits of refined sugar; a small plate of cut cheese,
another of biscuit, and a third bearing a couple of
lemons.</p>

<p>Everything about the room, in short, gave indication
of an approaching guzzle. The symptoms were unmistakeable.
The only occupant of the room at this time
was a gentleman, who sat in an arm-chair opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
fire, carelessly turning over the leaves of a new magazine.
His heart, evidently, was not in the employment;
he was merely putting off time, and doing so with some
impatience of manner, for he was ever and anon pulling
out his watch to see how the night sped on.</p>

<p>This gentleman was Mr. Walkinshaw, the doctor's
inviter, head clerk in a respectable mercantile establishment
in the city; and, we need hardly say, one of Mrs.
Paton's lodgers. Neither need we say, we fancy, that
he was just now waiting, and every moment expecting,
the arrival of the doctor, and the other friends he had
invited, nor that the preparations above described were
intended for the special enjoyment of the party alluded to.</p>

<p>"Five-and-twenty minutes to nine," said Mr. Walkinshaw,
looking for the twentieth time at the dial of
his watch. "I wonder what has become of the doctor!
<i>he</i> used to be so pointed."</p>

<p>At this moment a ring of the door bell announced a
visitor. Mr. Walkinshaw, in his impatience for the appearance
of his friends, and not doubting that this was
one of them, snatched up the candle, and ran to the
door himself. He opened it; when a little thick-set
figure, in Hessian boots, wrapped up in an ample blue
cloth cloak, with an immense cape, and having a red
comforter tied round his throat, presented himself. It
was the doctor.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do? and how d'ye do? Come away.
Glad to see you!" with cordial shaking of hands and
joyous smiles, marked the satisfaction with which the
inviter and the invited met. The doctor was in high
spirits, as he always was on such occasions; that is,
when there was a prospect of good eating and drinking,
and nothing to pay.</p>

<p>Having assisted the doctor to divest himself of his
cloak, hat, and comforter, Mr. Walkinshaw ushered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
into his room; and having kindly seated him in the
arm-chair which he had himself occupied a minute or
two before, he ran to the sideboard, took therefrom a
small bottle, and very small glass of the shape of a
thistle-top, and approaching his guest, said in a coaxing
tone, filling up at the same time&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thimbleful of brandy, doctor; just to take the
chill off." Anything for an excuse in such cases.</p>

<p>"Why, no objection, my dear sir," said the doctor,
smiling most graciously, taking the proffered glass of
ruby-coloured liquid, wishing health and a good wife to
his host, and tossing off the tiny bumper.</p>

<p>The doctor had scarcely bolted his alcohol, when the
door bell again rung violently.</p>

<p>"There <i>they</i> are at last!" exclaimed Walkinshaw,
joyously.</p>

<p>And there they were, to be sure. Half-a-dozen
rattling fellows all in a lump. In they poured into
Walkinshaw's room with hilarious glee.</p>

<p>"Ah, doctor. Oh, doctor. Here too, doctor. Hope
you're well, doctor. Glad to see you, doctor!" resounded
in all quarters; for they were all intimate
acquaintances of our medical friend, and were really
delighted to see him.</p>

<p>To this running fire of salutation, the doctor replied
by a series of becks, bows, and smiles, and a shaking
of hands, right and left, in rapid succession.</p>

<p>All these, and such like preliminaries, gone through,
the party took their seats around the table, and the
business of the evening began. It soon did more: it
progressed, and that most joyously. Jug followed jug
in rapid succession. The doctor got into exuberant
spirits, and sung several of his best songs, in his best
manner. But alas!&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Pleasures are," etc. etc.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>They are, sweet poet, and no man could be more
strongly impressed with, or would have more readily
allowed the truth and happy application of thy beautiful
similes, than the doctor, on the occasion of which
we are speaking. Enjoyment was quickly succeeded
by satiety; and alert apprehension, and quick perception,
by that doziness and obfuscation of the faculties
which marks the <i>quantum suff.</i> at the festive board.</p>

<p>The doctor was a man who could have said with the
face of clay&mdash;</p>

<p>
"And cursed be he who first cries, Hold, enough!"<br />
</p>

<p>But, being but mortal, after all, his powers were not
illimitable. There was a boundary which even he
could not pass, and at the same time lay his hand on
his breast and say, "I'm sober."</p>

<p>That boundary the doctor had now passed by a pretty
good way. In plain language, he was cut, very much
cut, as was made sufficiently evident by various little
symptoms,&mdash;such as a certain thickness of speech; a
certain diffusion of dull red over the whole countenance,
extending to and including the ears, which
seemed to become transparent, like a pair of thin, flat,
red pebbles; a certain look of stupidity and non-comprehension;
and a certain heaviness and lacklustreness
of eye, that gave these organs a strong resemblance to
a couple of parboiled gooseberries.</p>

<p>Sensible of his own condition, sensible that he could
hold out no longer, the doctor now moved, in the most
intelligible language which he could conveniently command,
that the diet should be deserted <i>pro loco et tempore</i>.</p>

<p>The motion was unanimously approved of; this unanimity
having been secured by the inability of several
of the party, who had been rendered <i>hors de combat</i>, to
express dissent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>A general break up, then, was the consequence of
the doctor's motion. Candle in hand, Mr. Walkinshaw
rose and accompanied his guests to the door, towards
which they moved in a long irregular file, he leading
the way. In the passage, however, a momentary halt
was called. It was to allow the doctor to don himself
in his walking gear. With some assistance from his
host, this was soon accomplished. His hat was stuck
on his head, his martial cloak thrown around him,
and his immense comforter, like a red blanket, coiled
around his neck. Thus accoutred, the doctor and his
friends evacuated the premises of their worthy host,
Mr. Walkinshaw.</p>


<p>THE RETURN HOME, AND INCIDENTS THEREFROM ARISING.</p>

<p>The doctor had not proceeded far on his way home,
until he found himself alone. One after another, his
friends had popped off; some disappearing mysteriously,
others giving fair warning of their departure, by shaking
him by the hand, and wishing him</p>

<p>
----"good night,<br />
And rosy dreams and slumbers light."<br />
</p>

<p>Left to his own reflections, and, we may add, to his
own exertions, the doctor stumped bravely homeward,
and, without meeting with anything particularly worthy
of notice, arrived safely at his own <i>close</i> mouth.</p>

<p>In another part of this history, we have mentioned
that there were one or two difficulties that always
awaited the doctor on his return home when in the
particular state in which he was at this moment. The
first of these difficulties was to climb the dark tortuous
staircase, on the third story of which was his domicile.
The second was to discriminate between his neighbours'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
door and his own. The reader will recollect that, to
obviate this last difficulty, the doctor fell upon the ingenious
expedient of counting the landing-places as he
ascended, his own being number three.</p>

<p>The reader's memory refreshed as to these particulars,
we proceed to say that the doctor, having traversed the
close with a tolerably firm and steady step, commenced
his laborious ascent of the stair in his usual manner,
but with evidently fully more difficulty, as some of the
neighbours, who heard his struggles, remarked, than
ordinary,&mdash;a circumstance from which they inferred&mdash;and
correctly enough, as we have seen&mdash;that the doctor
was more than ordinarily overcome.</p>

<p>The first flight of steps the doctor accomplished with
perfect success, and with perfect accuracy recorded it
as number one. This done, he commenced the ascent
of number two; and, after a severe struggle, accomplished
it also. But by the time he had done so, the
doctor had lost his reckoning, and, believing that he
had gained his own landing-place, from which, we
need hardly remind the reader, he was yet an entire
flight of stairs distant, he deliberately pulled out his
check-key, and applied it to the door of the neighbour
who lived right under him,&mdash;a certain Mr. Thomson,
who pursued the intellectual calling of a cheesemonger.</p>

<p>Having inserted the key in the lock, the doctor gave
it the necessary twitch; and, obedient to the hint, the
bolt rose, the door opened, and the doctor walked in.</p>

<p>Being pitch-dark, and the two houses&mdash;that is, the
doctor's and Mr. Thomson's&mdash;being of precisely the
same construction within, nothing presented itself to
the unconscious burglar to inform him of the blunder
he had made.</p>

<p>Satisfied, or rather never doubting, that all was
right, the doctor shut the door, and, groping along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
passage, sought the door of a small apartment on the
left, which, in his own house, was his bedroom. This
room he readily found; and it so happened that in Mr.
Thomson's house this same apartment was also a bedroom;
so that the doctor, under all circumstances,
could not be blamed for feeling perfectly at ease as to
his situation. In this feeling, he planted himself down
in a chair, and began deliberately to unbutton his waistcoat,
preparatory to tumbling in. While thus employed,
the doctor indulged in a sort of soliloquy, embracing
certain reflections and reminiscences connected with
his present condition and recent revelries.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the doctor, referring to his
present position. "Snug in my own bedroom. Capital
song yon of Ned's; one of Gilfirian's, I think. Writes
a beautiful song, Gil&mdash;a pretty song&mdash;very pretty.
Good feeling, sweet natural sentiment, and all that sort
of thing. Must get his new edition, and learn half-a-dozen
of them. Hah! confoundedly drunk though&mdash;that
lee-lurch ugly. Never mind: dead sober in the
morning; sound as a roach. Take a seidlitz, and all
right."</p>

<p>While thus expressing the ideas that were crowding
through his addled brain, the doctor's attention was
suddenly attracted by a noise at the outer door. He
paused to listen. It was some one, with a key, endeavouring
to gain access. What could it mean?
Thieves, robbers, no doubt of it. The doctor did not
doubt it. So, grasping a huge, thick crab-stick, which
he always carried at night, and which he had on the
present occasion laid against the wall close by where
he sat, the doctor stole on tiptoe towards the door,
and taking up a position about a yard distant from
it, raised his crab-stick aloft, and in this attitude
slily awaited the entrance of the thief, whom he pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>posed
to knock quietly down the moment he passed
the door-way.</p>

<p>Leaving the doctor in this gallant position for a few
seconds, we step aside to inform the reader of a circumstance
or two with which it is right he should be made
acquainted. In the first place, he should be, as he now
is, informed that the person at the door, and whom the
doctor took to be a midnight robber, was no other than
the doctor's neighbour, Mr. Thomson himself, the lawful
occupant of the house of which the former had taken
possession. He had happened, like the doctor, to have
been out late that night; and, like the doctor, too, was
several sheets in the wind. However, that is neither
here nor there to our story. But it is of some consequence
to it to add, inasmuch as it accounts for the
non-appearance of any one to avert the impending
catastrophe, that there was no one residing in Mr.
Thomson's house at the particular period of which we
speak, but Mr. Thomson himself; his wife, children,
and servant, being at sea-bathing quarters. Thus,
then, it was that the doctor had been allowed to take
and keep such undisturbed possession of the premises.</p>

<p>Again, the doctor being a bachelor, kept no servant
at all; the domestic duties of his establishment being
performed by an old woman, who came at an early
hour of the morning, remained all day, and left at
night.</p>

<p>There was thus no family circumstance connected
with his own domestic establishment, the absence of
which, on the present occasion, might have excited his
suspicions as to his real position. Everything, then,
favoured the unlucky chance now in progress. To
resume: The doctor having placed himself in the
hostile attitude already described, coolly and courageously
awaited the entrance of the supposed burglar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
He had not to wait long. The door opened; and, all unconscious
of what was awaiting him, Thomson entered.
It was all he was allowed to do, however; for, in the
next instant, a well-directed blow from the doctor's
crab-stick laid him senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>"Take that, you burglarious villain," shouted the
doctor triumphantly, on seeing the success of his
assault; "and that, and that, and that," he added,
plunging sundry forcible kicks into the body of his
prostrate victim with the points of his little stumpy
Hessians.</p>

<p>Having settled his man, as he imagined, the doctor
stooped down, and, seizing him by the neck of his coat,
proceeded to drag him to the outside of the door. This
was a work of some difficulty, as Thomson was rather
a heavy man; but it was accomplished. The doctor
exerted himself, and succeeded in hauling the unconscious
body of his unfortunate neighbour on to the
landing-place on the outside. Having got him there,
he edged him towards the descent, and, giving him a
shove with his foot, sent him rolling down the stairs.</p>

<p>The housebreaker thus disposed of, and put, as the
doctor believed, beyond all power of doing any more
mischief in this world, the latter, highly satisfied with
what he had done, and not a little vain of his prowess,
re-entered the house, carefully secured the door after
him with chain and bolt, and retired to the little bedroom
of which he had been before in possession.</p>

<p>Somewhat sobered by the occurrence which had just
taken place, the doctor now discovered various little
circumstances which rather surprised him. He could
not, for instance, find his nightcap; it was not in the
place where it used to be. Neither could he find the
boot-jack; it was not where it used to be either. The
bed, too, he thought, had taken up a strange position;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
it was not in the same corner of the room, and the
head was reversed. The head of his bed used to be
towards the door; he now found the foot in that direction.</p>

<p>All these little matters the doctor noted, and thought
them rather odd; but he set them all down to the
debit of his housekeeper,&mdash;some as the results of carelessness&mdash;such
as the absence of the nightcap and boot-jack;
others&mdash;the shifting of the bed and altering its
position&mdash;to the whim of some new arrangement.</p>

<p>Thus satisfactorily accounting for the little omissions
and discrepancies he noted, the doctor began to peel;
and, in a short time after, was snugly buried beneath
the blankets, with his red comforter round his head in
place of a nightcap.</p>

<p>Leaving the doctor for a time, thus comfortably
quartered, we will look after the unfortunate victim of
his prowess, whose rights he was now so complacently
usurping.</p>

<p>For fully half an hour after he had been bundled
down stairs by the doctor in the way already described,
poor Thomson lay without sense or motion. At about
the end of that time, however, he so far recovered as
to be able to emit two or three dismal groans, which
happening to be overheard by the policeman on the
station, who was at the moment going his rounds, he
hastened towards the quarter from whence the alarming
sounds proceeded, and found the ill-used cheesemonger
lying at full length on the stair, head downwards,
and, of course, feet uppermost.</p>

<p>The policeman held his lantern close to the face of
the unfortunate man, to see if he could recognise him;
but this he could not, and that for two reasons: First,
being newly come to the station, he did not know
Thomson at all; and, second, the countenance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
latter was so covered with blood, and otherwise disfigured,
that, suppose he had, he could not possibly
have recognised him.</p>

<p>Seeing the man in a senseless state, and, as he
thought, perhaps mortally injured, the policeman hastened
to the office to give notice of his situation, and
to procure assistance to have him carried there; all of
which was speedily done. A bier was brought, and on
this bier the person of the unfortunate cheesemonger
was placed, and borne to the police office.</p>

<p>Medical aid being here afforded to the sufferer, he
was soon brought so far round as to be able to give
some account of himself, and of the misfortune which
had befallen him. His face, too, having been cleared
of the blood by which it was disguised, he was recognised
by several persons in the office; and being
known to be a respectable man, the wonder was greatly
increased to see him in so lamentable a condition. Mr.
Thomson's account, however, of the occurrences of the
night explained all.</p>

<p>He stated that, on returning home to his own house,
in which there was no one living at present but himself,
he was encountered by some one in the passage,
and knocked down the instant he entered the door.
Who or what the person was he could not tell, but he
had no doubt that it was some one who had entered
the house for the purpose of robbing it; and added
his belief that the house was filled with robbers, who,
he had no doubt, had plundered it of every portable
article worth carrying away.</p>

<p>How he came to be found on the stair he could not
tell, but supposed that he had been dragged there after
he had been knocked down&mdash;that proceeding having
deprived him of all consciousness.</p>

<p>Here ended Mr. Thomson's deposition; and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
was the sensation, great the commotion which it excited
in the police office. So daring a burglary&mdash;so daring
an assault. The like had not been heard of for years.
In a twinkling, eight or ten men were mustered,
lanterned, and bludgeoned; and, headed by a sergeant,
were on their march to the scene of robbery.</p>

<p>On arriving at Mr. Thomson's door, they found it
fast, and all quiet within. What was to be done?
Force open the door? Perhaps some of the villains
were still in the house. At any rate, it was proper to
see what state things were in.</p>

<p>A smith was accordingly sent for, the lock picked, and
the door thrown open, when, headed by the sergeant
with a pistol in his hand, in rushed a mob of policemen,
a constellation of lanterns, a forest of bludgeons.</p>

<p>The guardians of the night now dispersed themselves
over the house; but, to their great surprise,
found no trace whatever of the thieves. There appeared
to have been nothing disturbed, and the doors and
windows remained all fast.</p>

<p>Puzzled by these circumstances, the police had begun
to abate somewhat of that zeal with which they had
first commenced their search, and were standing together
in knots, some in one room and some in another,
discussing the probabilities and likelihoods of the case,
when those in the doctor's apartment were suddenly
startled by a loud snore or grunt, proceeding from the
bed, which was followed by a restless movement, and
the exclamation&mdash;"Thieves, robbers!" muttered in the
thick indistinct way of a person dreaming.</p>

<p>In an instant, half a dozen policemen rushed towards
the bed, drew aside the curtains, and there beheld the
unconscious face of the heroic little doctor just peering
out of the blankets, and a section of the red comforter
in which his head was entombed in the manner already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
set forth. We have said that the face on which the
astonished policemen now looked was an unconscious
one. So it was; for, notwithstanding the grunt he
had emitted, the movement he had made, and the
exclamations he had uttered, the doctor was still sound
asleep; the former having been merely the result of
dreamy reminiscences of the past, awakened by an
indistinct sense of the presence of some person or persons
in the house.</p>

<p>In mute surprise, the police, every one holding his
lantern aloft, and thus surrounding the bed with a
halo of light, gazed for a second or two on the sleeping
Esculapius. They had never, in the course of all
their experience, seen a burglar take things so coolly
and comfortably. That he should enter a house with
the intention of robbing it, and should deliberately
strip, go to bed, and take a snooze in that house, was
a piece of such daring impudence as they had never
heard of before.</p>

<p>It was no time, however, for making reflections on
the subject. The business in hand was to secure the
villain; and this was promptly done. Finding his
sleep so profound as not to be easily disturbed, half a
dozen men, lanterns and sticks in hand, flung themselves
on the doctor, and, seizing him by the legs and
arms, had him in a twinkling on the floor on the
breadth of his back. Confounded and bewildered as
he was by the extraordinary and appalling circumstances
in which he now found himself&mdash;surrounded
with what appeared to him to be a mob&mdash;lanterns flitting
about as thick as the sparks on a piece of burned
paper&mdash;cudgels bristling around him like a paling&mdash;and,
to complete all, a clamour and hubbub of tongues
that might have been heard three streets off;&mdash;we
say, confounded and bewildered as he was by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
sights and sounds, the doctor's pluck did not desert
him. Starting to his feet, and not doubting that he
was in the midst of a mob of housebreakers, he seized
one of the policemen by the throat, when a deadly
struggle ensued, in which the doctor's shirt was, in a
twinkling, torn up into ribbons; in another twinkling
he was floored by a blow from a baton, and rendered
incapable of further resistance.</p>

<p>The combat had been a most unequal one, and no
other consequence could possibly have arisen from it.</p>

<p>Having knocked down the doctor, the next business,
as is usual in such and similar cases, was to get him up
again. Accordingly, three or four men got hold of
him by the arms and shoulders, and having raised him
to his feet, planted him, still senseless, in a chair.</p>

<p>A clamorous consultation, spoken in half a dozen
different dialects, now ensued, as to how the housebreaker
was to be disposed of.</p>

<p>"We'll teuk him to the office, to pe surely," said a
hard-faced, red-whiskered Celt. "What else you'll do
wi' ta roke that'll proke into shentleman's hoose, and
go to ped as comfortable as a lort. Dam's impitence."</p>

<p>"Soul, and it's to the office we'll have him, by all
manner o' means, and that in the twinkling of a bedpost,"
chimed in a tall raw-boned Irishman, with a
spotted cotton handkerchief tied so high around the
lower part of his face as to bury his mouth. "The
thaif o' the world. It's a free passage across the
wather he'll now get, anyhow, bad luck to him."</p>

<p>"Fat, tiel, would you tak the man stark naked
through the street?" said a little thick-set Aberdonian.
"It would be verra undecent. There's a bit cloaky
there; throw that aboot his shouthers, and then we'll
link him awa like a water-stoup."</p>

<p>"Od, ye'll no fin that so easy, I'm thinkin!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
a lumpish, broad-shouldered young fellow. "He's as
fat's a Lochrin distillery pig. He's a hantle mair like
his meat than his wark, that ane."</p>

<p>Hitherto the unfortunate subject of these remarks
had been able to take no part in what was passing;
but, stupefied by the blow he had received, which had
covered his face with blood, and further confounded
by the various circumstances of the case&mdash;his previous
debauch, the violence and suddenness of his awakening,
and the extraordinary clamour and uproar that surrounded
him&mdash;he sat, with drooping head and confused
senses, without uttering a word.</p>

<p>His physical energies, however, gradually recovering
a little, he began to stare about him with a look of
bewilderment; and at length, fixing his eye on the
Irishman, who happened to be standing directly opposite
him, he addressed him with a&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, friend, what is the meaning of all this?"</p>

<p>"Faiks, my purty fellow, and it's yourself that might
be after guessing that with your own 'cute genius,"
replied Paddy. "Haven't you half a notion, now, of
what you have been about the same blessed night?"</p>

<p>"I have a pretty good notion that my house has
been broken into by a parcel of ruffians," said the
doctor, "and that I have been half, perhaps wholly,
murdered by you."</p>

<p>"Capital, ould fellow; capital," said the Irishman.
"Tell truth, and shame the devil. Your house! Stick
to that, my jewel, and you'll astonish the spalpeens.
But come, come, my tight little mannikin, get up wid
ye. You'll go and have a peep of <i>our</i> house now.
Time about's fair play."</p>

<p>And he seized the doctor, who was now wrapped in
his cloak, and was forcing him from his seat, when the
latter, resisting this movement, called out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does no one here know me? Will no one here
protect me? What am I assailed in my own house
in this manner for? My name's Dobbie&mdash;Doctor
Dobbie!"</p>

<p>"Your name's no nosin to nobody, you roke," said
Duncan M'Kay, seconding the efforts of his colleague
to lug the doctor out of his seat. "You'll be one names
to-day and anodder names to-morrow. So shust come
along to ta office, toctor&mdash;since you calls yourselfs a
toctor&mdash;and teuket a nicht's quarters wi' some o' your
frients that's there afore you."</p>

<p>"Let's get a grup o' him," exclaimed the broad-shouldered
young fellow already spoken of, edging
himself in to have a share in the honour of laying a
capturing hand on the doctor. "Od, he's as round as
a pokmanky. There's nae getting hand o' him. Come
awa, doctor; come awa, my man. Bailie Morton 'll be
unco glad to see ye," he added, having succeeded in
getting hold of one of the doctor's arms, which he seized
with a grip like a vice.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the overpowering force with which
he was assailed, the doctor still resisted, vainly announcing
and re-announcing his name and calling. It had
the effect only of increasing the clamour and hubbub
amongst the police, who now all huddled round him in
a mob; and without listening to a word he said, finally
succeeded in carrying him bodily out of the house, in
despite of some desperate struggling, and a great deal
of noisy vociferation on the part of the doctor.</p>


<p>THE POLICE OFFICE, AND FINALE.</p>

<p>Leading off from and immediately behind the public
office, there was a small carpeted room, provided with
a sofa, some chairs, and a writing-desk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>This room was appropriated to some of the upper
functionaries connected with the police establishment
of &mdash;&mdash;, and was the scene of private examinations of
culprits, and of other kinds of proceedings of a private
nature.</p>

<p>At the time at which we introduce the reader to this
apartment, there lay extended on the sofa above spoken
of, a gentleman who appeared to have seen some recent
service, if one might judge from the circumstance of
his head being bound up in a blood-stained handkerchief,
and his exhibiting some symptoms of languor
and debility. This gentleman was Mr. Thomson, who
was awaiting the result of the expedition which had
gone to examine his house, and whose return he was
now momentarily expecting. Awaiting the same issue
then, and awaiting it in the same apartment, was
another gentleman. This person was a sort of sub-superintendent
of the police; and was, at the moment
of which we speak, busily engaged writing at the desk
formerly mentioned.</p>

<p>Both of those persons, then, were anxiously waiting
the return of the detachment whose proceedings are
already before the reader, beguiling the time, meanwhile,
by discussing the probabilities of the case. They
were thus engaged, when a tremendous noise in the
outer office gave intimation of an arrival, and one of
no ordinary kind; for the tramping of feet was immense,
and the hubbub astounding.</p>

<p>"That's <i>them</i>," said Mr. Thomson.</p>

<p>"I think it is," said the sub.</p>

<p>Ere any other remark could be made, the door of
the private apartment was opened, and in marched a
short, stout, half-dressed, bloody-faced gentleman, in a
blue cloth cloak, between two policemen, and followed
by a mob of functionaries of the same description, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
stood so thick as to completely block up the door. This
stout, half-dressed gentleman in the blue cloth cloak was
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Dear me, doctor," said Mr. Thomson, advancing
towards the former, whom he at once recognised,
"what's the matter? What terrible affair is this?"</p>

<p>"Terrible indeed&mdash;unheard of, monstrous!" exclaimed
the doctor, in a towering passion. "My
house, sir, has been broken into by these ruffians. I
have been torn from my bed, maltreated in the way
you see, and dragged here like a felon by them, and
for what I know not. But I <i>will</i> know it; and if I
don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is odd, doctor," here interposed Mr. Thomson;
"I have been the victim of a similar kind of violence
to-night, as you may see by the state of my head,
although the case is in other respects somewhat different.
My house has been also broken into."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, very strange!" said the doctor, taking
a momentary interest in the misfortunes of his neighbour.
"By these ruffians?" he added, pointing to the police.</p>

<p>"No, no, not them," replied Thomson; "housebreakers.
Some villains had got into the house; and
I had no sooner entered it, on returning home a little
later than usual, than I was knocked down, dragged
out to the stair, and thrown down, where I was found
in a state of insensibility and brought here."</p>

<p>The doctor winced a little at this statement: a vague
suspicion, we can hardly say of the fact, but of something
akin thereto, began to glimmer dimly on his
mental optics. He, however, said nothing; nor, even
had he been inclined to say anything, was opportunity
afforded him; for here the presiding official of the place,
the sub-superintendent, to whom the doctor was well
known, and who had impatiently awaited the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the conversation between the latter and Thomson,
interfered with a&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good heaven, doctor, how came you to be in this
situation? What is the meaning of all this?" he added,
turning to his men.</p>

<p>"The maining's as plain as a pike-staff, your honour,"
replied the Irish watchman, to whom we have already
introduced the reader. "We found this little gentleman,
since he turns out to be a gentleman, where he
shouldn't have been."</p>

<p>"And where was that, pray?" inquired the sub.</p>

<p>"Why, in Mr. Thomson's house, your honour. And
not only that, but in bed too, as snug as a fox in a
chimbley."</p>

<p>"In ta fery peds, ta roke!" here chimed in our friend
M'Kay.</p>

<p>"What! you don't mean to say that you found the
doctor here in <i>Mr. Thomson's</i> house?" said the astonished
official, laying a marked emphasis on the name.</p>

<p>"To pe surely we do, sir," replied Duncan.</p>

<p>"I'll tak my Bible oath till't," added another personage,
whom the reader will readily recognise.</p>

<p>"In my house! The doctor in <i>my</i> house!" exclaimed
Mr. Thomson, in the utmost amazement.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thomson's house! Me in Mr. Thomson's
house!" said the doctor, with a look of blank dismay;
for a tolerably distinct view of the truth had now begun
to present itself to his mind's eye. It was, therefore,
rather in the desperate hope of there being yet some
chance in his favour, than from any conviction that the
testimony against him was founded in error, that he
added&mdash;</p>

<p>"My <i>own</i> house, you scoundrels; you found me in
my <i>own</i> house!"</p>

<p>Here the whole mob of policemen simultaneously, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
as if with one voice, shouted&mdash;"It's a lie, it's a lie. We
found him in Mr. Thomson's."</p>

<p>"How do you explain this, doctor?" said Mr. Thomson
mildly, although beginning&mdash;he couldn't help it&mdash;to
think rather queerly of the doctor.</p>

<p>"Why, why," replied the crest-fallen and perplexed
doctor, "if I really have been in your house, Mr.
Thomson, although I can't believe it, I must, I must&mdash;in
fact, I must have mistaken it for my own. To tell
a truth, I came home rather cut last night; and it is
possible, quite possible, although I can hardly think
probable, that I may have taken your house for my
own. That's the fact," added the doctor, with something
like an appeal to the lenity of the person whose
rights he had so unwittingly usurped, and whose corporeal
substance he had so seriously maltreated.</p>

<p>"And was it you that knocked me down, doctor?"
said Mr. Thomson. "Too bad that, to knock me down
in my own house."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir, I trust I did not. I hope I did
not. But really I don't know; perhaps I&mdash;you see, I
thought thieves were coming in, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here a burst of laughter from the presiding officer,
which was instantly taken up by every one in the
apartment, and in which Thomson himself couldn't help
joining, interrupted the doctor's further explanations.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor," said the latter, who was a good-natured
sort of person, and who, like every one else,
had a kind of esteem for the little medical gentleman,
"I must say that when you broke my head, you were
only in the way of your trade; but I think the least
thing you can do is to mend it for nothing."</p>

<p>"Most gladly, my dear sir," replied the doctor; "for
I did the damage,&mdash;at least I fear it, however unknowingly,&mdash;and
am bound to repair it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Done; let it be a bargain," said Thomson. "But,
doctor, be so good as to give me previous notice when
you again desire to take possession of my house. At
any rate, don't knock me down when I come to seek a
share of it."</p>

<p>The doctor promised to observe the conditions; and
shortly after, the two left the office, arm in arm, in the
most friendly way imaginable.</p>

<p>It is said, although we cannot vouch for the truth of
the report, that the doctor, after this, fell upon the
expedient of casting a knot on his handkerchief for
each landing-place in the stair as he gained it, when
ascending the latter under such circumstances as those
that gave rise to the awkward occurrence which has
been the subject of these pages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_SEEKER" id="THE_SEEKER"></a>THE SEEKER.</h2>


<p>Amongst the many thousand readers of these tales,
there are perhaps few who have not observed that the
object of the writers is frequently of a higher kind than
that of merely contributing to their amusement. They
would wish "to point a moral," while they endeavour
to "adorn a tale." It is with this view that I now
lay before them the history of a <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>. The first
time I remember hearing, or rather of noticing the
term, was in a conversation with a living author respecting
the merits of a popular poet, when, his religious
opinions being adverted to, it was mentioned that, in a
letter to a brother poet of equal celebrity, he described
himself as a <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>. I was struck with the word and
its application. I had never met with the fool who
saith in his heart that there is no God; and though I
had known many deniers of revelation, yet a <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>,
in the sense in which the word was applied, appeared
a new character. But, on reflection, I found it an
epithet applicable to thousands, and adopted it as a
title to our present story.</p>

<p>Richard Storie was the eldest son of a Dissenting
minister, who had the pastoral charge of a small congregation
a few miles from Hawick. His father was
not what the world calls a man of talent, but he possessed
what is far beyond talents&mdash;piety and humanity.
In his own heart he felt his Bible to be true&mdash;its words
were as a lamp within him; and from his heart he
poured forth its doctrines, its hopes, and consolations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to others, with a fervour and an earnestness which
Faith only can inspire. It is not the thunder of declamation,
the pomp of eloquence, the majesty of
rhetoric, the rounded period, and the glow of imagery,
which can chain the listening soul, and melt down the
heart of the unbeliever, as metals yield to the heat of
the furnace. Show me the hoary-headed preacher,
who carries sincerity in his very look and in his very
tones, who is animated because faith inspires him, and
out of the fulness of his own heart his mouth speaketh,
and there is the man from whose tongue truth floweth
as from the lips of an apostle; and the small still voice
of conscience echoes to his words, while hope burns,
and the judgment becomes convinced. Where faith is
not in the preacher, none will be produced in the
hearer. Such a man was the father of Richard Storie.
He had fulfilled his vows, and prayed with and for his
children. He set before them the example of a
Christian parent, and he rejoiced to perceive that that
example was not lost upon them.</p>

<p>We pass over the earlier years of Richard Storie, as
during that period he had not become a <span class="smcap">Seeker</span>, nor did
he differ from other children of his age. There was
indeed a thoughtfulness and sensibility about his character;
but these were by no means so remarkable as to
require particular notice, nor did they mark his boyhood
in a peculiar degree. The truths which from
his childhood he had been accustomed to hear from his
father's lips, he had never doubted; but he felt their
truth as he felt his father's love, for both had been imparted
to him together. He had fixed upon the profession
of a surgeon, and at the age of eighteen he
was sent to Edinburgh to attend the classes. He was
a zealous student, and his progress realized the fondest
wishes and anticipations of his parent. It was during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
his second session that Richard was induced, by some
of his fellow collegians, to become a member of a debating
society. It was composed of many bold and
ambitious young men, who, in the confidence of their
hearts, rashly dared to meddle with things too high for
them. There were many amongst them who regarded
it as a proof of manliness to avow their scepticism, and
who gloried in scoffing at the eternal truths which had
lighted the souls of their fathers when the darkness of
death fell upon their eyelids. It is one of the besetting
sins of youth to appear wise above what is written.
There were many such amongst those with whom Richard
Storie now associated. From them he first heard the
truths which had been poured into his infant ear from
his father's lips attacked, and the tongue of the scoffer
rail against them. His first feeling was horror, and he
shuddered at the impiety of his friends. He rose to
combat their objections and refute their arguments, but
he withdrew not from the society of the wicked. Week
succeeded week, and he became a leading member of
the club. He was no longer filled with horror at the
bold assertions of the avowed sceptic, nor did he manifest
disgust at the ribald jest. As night silently and
imperceptibly creeps through the air, deepening shade
on shade, till the earth lies buried in its darkness, so
had the gloom of <i>Doubt</i> crept over his mind, deepening
and darkening, till his soul was bewildered in the
sunless darkness.</p>

<p>The members acted as chairman of the society in
rotation, and, in his turn, the office fell upon Eichard
Storie. For the first time, he seemed to feel conscious
of the darkness in which his spirit was enveloped; conscience
haunted him as a hound followeth its prey; and
still its small still voice whispered,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Who sitteth in the scorner's chair."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The words seemed burning on his memory. He tried
to forget them, to chase them away&mdash;to speak of, to
listen to other things; but he could not. "<i>Who sitteth
in the scorner's chair</i>" rose upon his mind as if printed
before him&mdash;as if he heard the words from his father's
tongue&mdash;as though they would rise to his own lips.
He was troubled&mdash;his conscience smote him&mdash;the darkness
in which his soul was shrouded was made visible.
He left his companions&mdash;he hastened to his lodgings,
and wept. But his tears brought not back the light
which had been extinguished within him, nor restored
the hopes which the pride and the rashness of reason
had destroyed. He had become the willing prisoner of
<i>Doubt</i>, and it now held him in its cold and iron grasp,
struggling in despair.</p>

<p>Reason, or rather the self-sufficient arrogance of
fancied talent which frequently assumes its name, endeavoured
to suppress the whisperings of conscience in
his breast; and in such a state of mind was Richard
Storie, when he was summoned to attend the death-bed
of his father. It was winter, and the snow lay deep on
the ground, and there was no conveyance to Hawick
until the following day; but, ere the morrow came,
eternity might be between him and his parent. He
had wandered from the doctrines that parent had
taught, but no blight had yet fallen on the affections
of his heart. He hurried forth on foot; and having
travelled all night in sorrow and anxiety, before daybreak
he arrived at the home of his infancy. Two of
the elders of the congregation stood before the door.</p>

<p>"Ye are just in time, Mr. Richard," said one of them
mournfully, "for he'll no be lang now; and he has
prayed earnestly that he might only be spared till ye
arrived."</p>

<p>Richard wept aloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, try and compose yoursel', dear sir," said the
elder. "Your distress may break the peace with which
he's like to pass away. It's a sair trial, nae doubt&mdash;a
visitation to us a'; but ye ken, Richard, we must not
mourn as those who have no hope."</p>

<p>"Hope!" groaned the agonized son as he entered
the house. He went towards the room where his father
lay; his mother and his brethren sat weeping around
the bed.</p>

<p>"Richard!" said his afflicted mother as she rose and
flung her arms around his neck. The dying man heard
the name of his first-born, his languid eyes brightened,
he endeavoured to raise himself upon his pillow, he
stretched forth his feeble hand. "Richard!&mdash;my own
Richard!" he exclaimed; "ye hae come, my son; my
prayer is heard, and I can die in peace! I longed to
see ye, for my spirit was troubled upon yer account&mdash;sore
and sadly troubled; for there were expressions in
yer last letter that made me tremble&mdash;that made me
fear that the pride o' human learning was lifting up the
heart o' my bairn, and leading his judgment into the
dark paths o' error and unbelief; but oh! these tears
are not the tears of an unbeliever!"</p>

<p>He sank back exhausted. Richard trembled. He
again raised his head.</p>

<p>"Get the books," said he feebly, "and Richard will
make worship. It is the last time we shall all join together
in praise on this earth, and it will be the last
time I shall hear the voice o' my bairn in prayer, and
it is long since I heard it. Sing the hymn,</p>

<blockquote><p>'The hour of my departure's come,'</p></blockquote>

<p>and read the twenty-third psalm."</p>

<p>Richard did as his dying parent requested; and as
he knelt by the bedside, and lifted up his voice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
prayer, his conscience smote him, agony pierced his
soul, and his tongue faltered. He now became a
Seeker, seeking mercy and truth at the same moment;
and, in the agitation of his spirit, his secret thoughts
were revealed, his doubts were manifested! A deep
groan issued from the dying-bed. The voice of the
supplicant failed him&mdash;his <i>amen</i> died upon his lips;
he started to his feet in confusion.</p>

<p>"My son! my son!" feebly cried the dying man,
"ye hae lifted yer eyes to the mountains o' vanity, and
the pride o' reason has darkened yer heart, but, as yet,
it has not hardened it. Oh Richard! remember the
last words o' yer dying faither: 'Seek, and ye shall
find.' Pray with an humble and a contrite heart, and
in yer last hour ye will hae, as I hae now, a licht to
guide ye through the dark valley of the shadow of
death."</p>

<p>He called his wife and his other children around
him&mdash;he blessed them&mdash;he strove to comfort them&mdash;he
committed them to his care who is the Husband of
the widow and the Father of the fatherless. The lustre
that lighted up his eyes for a moment, as he besought a
blessing on them, vanished away, his head sank back
upon his pillow, a low moan was heard, and his spirit
passed into peace.</p>

<p>His father's death threw a blight upon the prospects
of Richard. He no longer possessed the means of prosecuting
his studies; and in order to support himself
and assist his mother, he engaged himself as tutor in the
family of a gentleman in East Lothian. But there his
doubts followed him, and melancholy sat upon his breast.
He had thoughtlessly, almost imperceptibly, stepped into
the gloomy paths of unbelief, and anxiously he groped
to retrace his steps; but it was as a blind man stumbles;
and in wading through the maze of controversy for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
guide, his way became more intricate, and the darkness
of his mind more intense. He repented that he had ever
listened to the words of the scoffer, or sat in the chair
of the scorner; but he had permitted the cold mists of
scepticism to gather round his mind, till even the affections
of his heart became blighted by their influence.
He was now a solitary man, shunning society; and at
those hours when his pupils were not under his charge,
he would wander alone in the wood or by the river,
brooding over unutterable thoughts, and communing
with despair; for he sought not, as is the manner of
many, to instil the poison that had destroyed his own
peace into the minds of others. He carried his punishment
in his soul, and was silent&mdash;in the soul that was
doubting its own existence! Of all hypochondriacs,
to me the unbeliever seems the most absurd. For can
matter think? can it reason, can it doubt? Is it not the
thing that doubts which distrusts its own being? Often
when he so wandered, the last words of his father&mdash;"Seek,
and ye shall find"&mdash;were whispered in his heart,
as though the spirit of the departed breathed them over
him. Then would he raise his hands in agony, and his
prayer rose from the solitude of the woods.</p>

<p>After acting about two years as tutor, he returned
to Edinburgh and completed his studies. Having
with difficulty, from the scantiness of his means, obtained
his diplomas, he commenced practice in his
native village. His brothers and his sisters had arrived
at manhood and womanhood, and his mother enjoyed
a small annuity. Almost from boyhood he had been
deeply attached to Agnes Brown, the daughter of a
neighbouring farmer; and about three years after he
had commenced practice, she bestowed on him her
hand. She was all that his heart could wish&mdash;meek,
gentle, and affectionate; and her anxious love threw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
gleam of sunshine over the melancholy that had settled
upon his soul. Often, when he fondly gazed in her
eyes, where affection beamed, the hope of immortality
would flash through his bosom; for one so good, so
made of all that renders virtue dear, but to be born to
die and to be no more, he deemed impossible. They
had been married about nine years, and Agnes had
become the mother of five fair children, when in one
day death entered their dwelling, and robbed them of
two of their little ones. The neighbours had gathered
together to comfort them, and the mother in silent
anguish wept over her babes; but the father stood
tearless and stricken with grief, as though his hopes
were sealed up in the coffin of his children. In his
agony he uttered words of strange meaning. The
doubts of the Seeker burst forth in the accents of
despair. The neighbours gazed at each other. They
had before had doubts of the religious principles of
Dr. Storie; now those doubts were confirmed. Many
began to regard him as an unsafe man to visit a death-bed,
where he might attempt to rob the dying of the
everlasting hope which enables them to triumph over
the last enemy. His practice fell off, and the wants
of his family increased. He was no longer able to
maintain an appearance of respectability. His circumstances
aggravated the gloom of his mind; and for a
time he became, not a Seeker, but one who abandoned
himself to callousness and despair. Even the affection
of his wife&mdash;which knew no change, but rather increased
as affliction and misfortune came upon them&mdash;with
the smiles and affection of his children, became
irksome. Their love increased his misery. His own
house was all but forsaken, and the blacksmith's shop
became his consulting room, the village alehouse his
laboratory.  Misery and contempt heightened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
"shadows, clouds, and darkness" which rested on his
mind. To his anguish and excitement he had now
added habits of intemperance; his health became a
wreck, and he sank upon his bed, a miserable and a
ruined man. The shadow of death seemed lowering
over him, and he lay trembling, shrinking from its
approach, shuddering and brooding over the cheerless,
the horrible thought&mdash;<i>annihilation</i>! But, even then,
his poor Agnes watched over him with a love stronger
than death. She strove to cheer him with the thought
that he would still live&mdash;that they would again be
happy. "Oh my husband!" cried she fondly, "yield
not to despair; <i>seek, and ye shall find</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh heavens, Agnes!" exclaimed he, "I have sought!&mdash;I
have sought! I have been a <span class="smcap">Seeker</span> until now;
but Truth flees from me, Hope mocks me, and the
terrors of Death only find me!"</p>

<p>"Kneel with me, my children," she cried; "let us
pray for mercy and peace of mind for your poor father!"
And the fond wife and her offspring knelt around the
bed where her husband lay. A gleam of joy passed
over the sick man's countenance, as the voice of her
supplication rose upon his ear, and a ray of hope fell
upon his heart. "<i>Amen</i>!" he uttered as she arose; and
"<i>Amen</i>!" responded their children.</p>

<p>On the bed of sickness his heart had been humbled;
he had, as it were, seen death face to face; and the
nearer it approached, the stronger assurances did he
feel of the immortality he had dared to doubt. He
arose from his bed a new man; hope illumined, and
faith began to glow in his bosom. His doubts were
vanquished, his fears dispelled. He had sought, and
at length found the hopes of the Christian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WAGER.<a name="FNanchor_3_" id="FNanchor_3_"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>


<p>About thirty years ago, the office of carrier between
Edinburgh and a certain town on the north of the Tay
was discharged by a person of the name of George
Skirving. At the time of which we speak he might
be about forty-five years of age, a man of considerable
physical strength, and with as much mental firmness as
will be found among the generality of mankind. His
occupation, in travelling during night, required often
the confirming influence of personal courage, to keep
him from being alarmed; and his activity, and exposure
to the fresh air of both land and water, were conducive
to bodily health and elasticity of spirits. He
was at once a faithful carrier and a good companion
on the road, along which he was generally respected;
and, by attention to business and economical habits of
living, he had been enabled to realize as much money
as might suffice to sustain him, with his wife and three
children, in the event of his being disabled, by accident
or ill health, from following his ordinary employment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_" id="Footnote_3_"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This strange tale is given from materials supplied by the
Surgeon with whom I was brought up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The day in which George Skirving left the northern
town for Edinburgh, was Wednesday of each week; and
he started at the hour of seven, both in winter and summer.
On one occasion, in the month of August, he set
out from his quarters at his usual hour; and having
crossed the Tay with his goods, proceeded on his way</p>

<p>through Fife. He had with him his dog Wolf, who
usually served him as a companion; his waggons were
loaded with goods, the proceeds of the carriage of which
he counted as he trudged along; and he now and then
had recourse to a small flask of spirits which his wife
had, without his knowledge, and contrary to her usual
custom, placed in the breast-pocket of his great-coat.
He was thus in good spirits; and as he applied himself
with great moderation&mdash;for he was a sober man&mdash;to
his inspiring companion, he jocularly blamed Betty
(such was the name of his consort) for defrauding his
houses of call on the road of the custom he used to
bestow on them.</p>

<p>"It was kind o' ye, Betty," he said; "but it saves
naething; for if I, wha have travelled this road for sae
mony years, were to pass John Sharpe's, or Widow
M'Murdo's, or Andrew Gemmel's, without takin' my
usual allowance, I would be set doun as fey or mad. I
maun gae through a' my usual routine&mdash;mak my ca's,
order my drams, drink them, and pay for them, as I
hae dune for twenty years. Men are just like clocks&mdash;some
gae owre fast, and some owre slow; but the
carrier, beyond a', maun keep to his time aye, and <i>chap</i>
at the proper time and place, or idleness and beggary
would soon mak time hang weary on his hands."</p>

<p>He had trudged onwards in his slow pace for a space
of about eight miles, and was at the distance of about
three from Cupar, when he was accosted by a person of
the name of James Cowie, an inhabitant of Dundee, with
whom he had for a long time been in habits of intimacy.</p>

<p>"You are weel forward the day, George," said Cowie.
"Ye'll be in Cupar before your time. There's rowth
a parcels for ye at John Sharpe's door, yonder. But,
mercy on me!" he continued, starting and looking
amazed, "what's the matter wi' ye, man?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naething," replied George. "I hae been takin' a
few draps o' Betty's cordial, here," pointing to the flask,
"and maybe the colour may have mounted to my face."</p>

<p>"The colour mounted to your face, man!" ejaculated
Cowie. "Is it whiteness&mdash;paleness&mdash;ye mean by colour?
Ye're like a clout, man&mdash;a bleached clout. There's
something wrang, rely upon it, George; some o' that
intricate machinery o' our fearfu' systems out o' joint.
Is it possible ye have felt or feel nae change?"</p>

<p>"Nane whatever, Jamie," answered the carrier, somewhat
alarmed. "You're surely joking me; I never
felt better i' my life. No, no, Jamie, there's naething
the matter; thank God, I'm in gude health."</p>

<p>"It's weel ye think sae," replied Cowie, with a satirical
tone; "but if I'm no cheated, ye're on the brink
o' some fearfu' disease. Get up on your cart, man;
hasten to Cupar, an' speak to Doctor Lowrie. It's a
braw thing to tak diseases in time."</p>

<p>"If a white face is a' ye judge by," said George, attempting
to make light of the matter, "I can remove
it by an application to Betty's cordial."</p>

<p>"Ay, do that," said Cowie ironically, "and add fuel
to the flame. If I werena your friend, I wadna tak
this liberty wi' ye. I assure ye again, an' I hae some
judgment o' thae matters, that ye're very ill. That's
no an ordinary paleness: your lips are blue, an' your
eyes dull an' heavy&mdash;sure signs o' an oncome. Haste
ye to Cupar an' get advice, an' ye may yet ca' me your
best friend."</p>

<p>As he finished these words, Cowie turned to proceed
onwards towards Newport.</p>

<p>"Ye've either said owre little or owre muckle,
James," replied George, after a slight pause, and resigning
his carelessness.</p>

<p>"I hae just said the truth, George," added Cowie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
"but I maun be in Dundee by one o'clock, an' canna
wait. I'll say naething to Mrs. Skirving to alarm her;
but, for God's sake, tak my advice, an' consult Doctor
Lowrie."</p>

<p>He proceeded on his journey, leaving Skirving in
doubt and perplexity. At first he was considerably
affected by Cowie's speech and manner, because he
knew him to be a serious man, and averse to all manner
of joking. It was possible, he admitted, that a disease
might be lurking secretly in his vitals, unknown to
himself, but discernible to another; and the circumstance
of his wife having put the flask of cordial in his
coat-pocket, seemed to indicate that she had observed
something wrong before he set out, and had been afraid
to communicate it to him, in case it might alarm him.
His spirits sank, as this confirmation of Cowie's statement
came to his mind; he put his right hand to his
left wrist, to feel the state of the pulse, and, as might
have been expected, discovered (for he overlooked the
effects of his fear) that it was much quicker than it
used to be when he was in perfect health.</p>

<p>Having been taken thus by surprise, he remained in
a state of considerable depression for some time; but
when he came to think of the inadequate grounds of
his alarm, he began to rally; and his mind, rebounding,
as it were, on the cessation of the depressing
reverie, threw off the fear, and he recovered so far his
natural courage as to laugh at the strange fancy that
had taken possession of him.</p>

<p>"I was a fule," he said to himself. "What though
my face be pale, and my eyes heavy, and my pulse a
little quicker than usual, am I to dee for a' that?
Cowie has probably had his <i>morning</i>; and truly his
appearance, now when I think of it, didna assort ill
wi' that supposition. Johnny Sharpe and he are auld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
cronies, and they couldna part without some wet pledge
o' their auld friendship. I'll wad my best horse on
the point. Ha! ha! what a fule I was!" He accompanied
these words by again feeling his pulse. The
fear was greatly off, the pulsations had become more
regular; and this confirmation enabled him to laugh
off the effects the extraordinary announcements had
made upon him.</p>

<p>He proceeded onwards to Cupar, and stopped at
John Sharpe's inn. The landlord was at the door.
George looked at him narrowly, as he saluted him in
the ordinary form. He thought the innkeeper looked
also very narrowly at him, as he answered his salutation;
but he was afraid to broach the question of his
sickly appearance, and hurried away to get the goods
packed that stood at the inn door. Having finished
his work, during which he thought he saw the landlord
looking strangely at him, he called for the quantity
of spirits he was usually in the habit of getting,
and, as he filled out the glass, asked quickly if James
Cowie had been there that morning. The landlord
answered that he had; but added, of his own accord,
that he did not remain in the house so long as to give
time for even drinking to each other. This answer
produced a greater effect upon George than he was
even then aware of; and it is not unlikely that this,
and the impression that the landlord looked at him
<i>strangely</i>, produced the very paleness that Cowie had
mentioned. Be that as it may, he took up the glass of
spirits and laid it down again, without almost tasting
it; and his reason for this departure from his ordinary
course, was, that he had already partaken sufficiently
of his wife's cordial; and he had some strange misgivings
about drinking ardent spirits, in case, after all,
it might turn out that there was hanging about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
some disease. The moment he laid down the full glass,
the landlord said to him, looking in an inquiring and
sympathetic manner into his face&mdash;</p>

<p>"George, I haena seen you do that for ten years.
Are you well enough?"</p>

<p>"What! what! eh, what!" stammered out the carrier
confusedly; "do you think I'm ill, John?"</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when the
inn bell rang, and the landlord was called away, and,
being otherwise occupied, did not return. After waiting
for him a considerable time, Skirving became impatient,
and, making another effort to shake off his fears,
applied the whip to his horses, and proceeded on his
journey. For a time his mind was so much confused
that he could not contemplate the whole import of the
extraordinary coincidence he had just witnessed; but
as he proceeded and came to a quieter part of the road,
his thoughts reverted to the statements of James Cowie&mdash;who,
he was now satisfied, had been quite sober&mdash;to
the looks and extraordinary question of John Sharpe,
and to the intention of his wife in providing him with
the cordial. As he pondered on this strange accumulation
of according facts, he again felt his pulse, which
had again risen to the height it had attained during
the prior paroxysm. The affair had now assumed a
new aspect. It was impossible that this concurrence
of circumstances could be fortuitous. He was now
much afraid that he was ill&mdash;very ill indeed; perhaps
under the incipient symptoms of typhus or brain fever,
or small-pox, or some other dreadful disease. As
these thoughts rose in his mind, he grew faint, and
would have sat down; but he felt a reluctance to stop
his carts, and a feeling of shame struggled against his
conviction, and kept him walking.</p>

<p>This state of nervous excitement remained, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of many efforts he made to throw off his fears. Yet
he was bound to admit that he felt no symptoms
of pain or sickness. By and by the feeling of alarm
began again to decay, and by the time he got eight
or ten miles farther on his road, he had conjured up
a good many sustaining ideas and arguments, whereby
he at least contrived to increase the quantum of <i>doubt</i>
of his being really ill. He rallied a little again;
but the temporary elevation was destined to be succeeded
by another depression, which, in its turn, gave
place to another accession of relief; and thus he was
kept in a painful alternation of changing fancies, until
he was within a mile and a half of the next place
of call&mdash;a little house at some distance from the Plasterers'
Inn.</p>

<p>He had hitherto been progressing at a very slow
rate, and was in the act of raising his hand to apply
the whip to his horses, when he saw before him Archibald
Willison, a sort of itinerant cloth merchant, a
native of Dundee, with whom he was on terms of intimacy.
They had met often on the road, and had
gossiped together over a little refreshment at the inns
where the carrier stopped. At this particular time,
George Skirving would rather have avoided his old
friend; for he was under a depression of spirits, and
felt also a disinclination or fear, he could not account
for, to submit his face and appearance to the lynx eye
of the travelling merchant. He had, however, no
choice.</p>

<p>"Ah, George," cried Archie, "it's lang since I saw
ye. How are ye? What!"&mdash;starting as if surprised&mdash;"have
ye been lyin', man&mdash;confined&mdash;sick?&mdash;what,
in God's name, has been the matter wi' ye? Some sad
complaint, surely, to produce so mighty a change!"</p>

<p>This address seemed to George just the very confir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>mation
he now required to make him perfectly satisfied
of his danger. It was too much for him to hear and
suffer. Staggering back, he leant upon the side of his
cart, and drew breath with difficulty, attempting in
vain to give his friend some reply.</p>

<p>"It's wrang in ye, man," continued Archie, as he saw
the carrier labouring to find words to reply to him&mdash;"it's
wrang in ye, George, to be here in that state o'
body. How did Betty permit it? Wha wad guarantee
your no lyin' doun an' deein' by the road-side? I'm
sure I wadna undertake the suretyship."</p>

<p>"I have not been a day confined, Archie," said
George, as he slightly recovered from the shock caused
by the announcement. "I have not been ill; and left
home this morning in my usual health."</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Archie, "is that possible?
Then is it sae muckle the waur. I thought it had been
a' owre wi' ye&mdash;that ye had been ill, an' partly recovered;
but now I see the disease is only comin' yet.
How deadly pale ye are, man; an' what a strange
colour there is on your lips, round the sockets o' your
een, an' the edges o' your nostrils!"</p>

<p>"I hae been told that the day already, Archie," said
George; "I fear there's some truth in't. Yet I feel
nae pain; I'm only weak an' nervous."</p>

<p>"Ah, ye ken little about fevers o' the putrid kind&mdash;typhus,
an' the like," continued the other,&mdash;"when ye
think they show themselves by ordinary symptoms. I
had a cousin who died o' typhus last week; an' he
looked, when he took it, just as ye look, an' spoke just
as ye speak. Tak the advice o' a friend, George.
Dinna stop at Widow M'Murdo's; ye can get nae
advice there; hurry on to Edinburgh, and apply immediately,
on your arrival, to a doctor o' repute. I
assure ye a' his skill will be required."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>After some conversation, all tending to the same
effect, Willison parted from him, continuing his route
to Cupar. All the doubt that had existed in the mind
of the victim was now removed, and a settled conviction
took hold of him that he was on the very eve of
falling into some terrible illness. A train of gloomy
fancies took possession of his mind, and he pictured
himself lying extended on a bed of sickness, with the
angel of death hanging over him, and an awakened
conscience within, wringing him with its agonizing
tortures. The nature of the disease which impended
over him&mdash;the putrid typhus&mdash;was fixed, and put beyond
doubt; and all the cases he had known of individuals
who had died of that disease were brought before
the eye of his imagination, to feed the appetite for
horrors, which now began to crave food. He endeavoured
to analyze his sensations, and discovered, what
he never felt before, a hard, fluttering palpitation at
his heart, a difficulty of breathing, weakness, trembling
of the limbs, and other clear indications of the oncoming
attack of a fatal disease.</p>

<p>Moving slowly forward, under the load of these
thoughts, he arrived at Widow M'Murdo's, where he
fed his horses. He was silent and gloomy; and the
fear under which he laboured produced a <i>real</i> appearance
of illness, which soon struck the eye of the kind
dame.</p>

<p>"What ails ye?" asked she kindly; and ran and
brought out her bottle of cordial, to administer to him
that universal medicine. But her question was enough.
Moody and miserable, he paid little attention to her
kindness, and departed for Kirkcaldy. Under the
same load of despondency and apprehension, he arrived
at Andrew Gemmel's, where it was his practice to
remain all night. He exhibited the appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
person labouring under some grievous misfortune; and
deputing the feeding of his horses to the ostler, he
seemed to be careless whether justice was done to them
or not. The landlord noticed the change that had
taken place upon him. "What ails ye, George?" was
asked repeatedly; and the death-like import of the
question prevented him from giving any satisfactory
answer. Long before his usual period, he retired to
his bed, where he passed a night of fevered dreams,
restlessness, and misery.</p>

<p>In the morning, he was still under the operation of
his apprehension, and was unable to take any breakfast.
The ostler managed for him all the details of his
business, and he departed in the same gloomy mood for
Pettycur. Sauntering along at a slow pace, he met, half-way
between the two towns, Duncan Paterson, a Dundee
weaver, an old acquaintance, by whom he was
hailed in the ordinary form of salutation. But he
wished to proceed without standing to speak to his old
friend; for he was so sorely depressed, and was so
much afraid of another fearful announcement about his
sickly appearance, that he could not bear an interview.
This strange conduct seemed to rouse the curiosity of
his friend, who, running up to him, held forth his hand,
crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! George, man!&mdash;this is no like you, to pass
auld friends. What ails ye, man?"</p>

<p>"I dinna feel altogether weel," answered the carrier
in a mournful tone.</p>

<p>"I saw that, man, lang before ye cam up," replied
the other; "and it was just because ye were looking
so grievously ill, that I was determined to speak to ye.
When were ye seized?"</p>

<p>"I was weel when I left the north, yesterday morning;
but I hadna been lang on the road, when I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
to gie tokens o' illness," replied the carrier mournfully,
and with a drooping head.</p>

<p>"If I had met you in that waefu' state," said the
other, "with that death-like face and unnatural-like
look, I wadna have allowed ye to proceed a mile farther;
but now since ye're sae far on the road, it's just as weel
that ye hurry on to Edinburgh, whaur ye'll get the best
advice. What symptoms do ye feel?"</p>

<p>"I'm heavy and dull," replied George; "my pulse
rises and fa's, my heart throbs, and my legs hae been
shakin' under me, as if I were palsied."</p>

<p>"Ah, George, George! these are a' clear signs o'
typhus, man," replied Paterson. "My mother died o't.
I watched, wi' filial care and affection, a' her maist
minute symptoms. They were just yours. I'm vexed
for ye; but maybe the hand o' a skilfu' doctor may avert
the usual fatal issue."</p>

<p>"Was yer mither lang ill?" asked George in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"Nine days," answered Paterson. "By the seventh
she was spotted like a leopard, on the eighth she went
mad, and the ninth put an end to her sufferings."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," muttered George, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"But the power o' medicine's great," rejoined Paterson.
"Lose nae time, after ye arrive in Edinburgh, in
applying to a doctor. Mind my words."</p>

<p>And Paterson, casting upon him a look suited to the
parting statement, left the carrier, and proceeded on his
way. The victim, now completely immerged in melancholy,
progressed slowly onwards to Pettycur. His
downcast appearance attracted there the attention of
the people who assisted him in the discharge of his business.
The question, "What ails ye, George?" was repeated,
and answered by silence and a sorrowful look.
In the boat in which he crossed the Forth, his unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
sadness was also noticed by the captain and crew, with
whom he was intimately acquainted. As he sat in the
fore-part of the vessel, silent and gloomy, they repeated
the dreadful question&mdash;"What ails ye, George?"&mdash;that
had been so often before put to him. To some he said
he felt unwell, to others he replied by a melancholy
stare, and relapsed again into his melancholy.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Leith, he was assisted, according
to custom, by porters, in getting his goods disembarked.
The men were not long in noticing the great change
that had taken place upon his spirits. "What ails ye,
George?" was the uniform question; and every time
it was put it went to his heart, for it showed more and
more, as he thought, his sick-like appearance, which
seemed to escape the eyes of no one. The men assisted
him more assiduously than they had ever done before;
and having got everything ready, he proceeded
up Leith Walk. The toll-man noticed also his dejected
appearance, and the same question was put by him.
He proceeded to his quarters, and, committing his carts
to a man that was in the habit of assisting him, he went
into the house and threw himself into a chair. "What
ails ye, George?" exclaimed Widow Gilmour, as she
saw him exhibiting these indications of illness. He
said he felt unwell, and, rising, went away up to his
bedroom, where he retired to bed.</p>

<p>The torture of mind to which he had been exposed
for a day and a night, and a part of another day, with
the want of food, and the exercise of his trade, had
operated so powerfully on his body, that he was now
in reality in a fever. The landlady felt his pulse, and,
becoming alarmed, sent for a doctor, a young man, who
immediately bled him to a much greater extent than
was necessary; but the statements of George himself,
and the fevered appearance he presented, convinced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
young doctor that nothing but copious bleeding would
overcome the disease. The application of the lancet
stamped the whole affair with the character of reality;
and the sick man, still overcome by gloomy anticipations,
was soon in the very height of a dangerous fever.
Two days afterwards, his wife was sent for; but the
poor man got gradually worse, and, notwithstanding all
the efforts of the doctor, was soon pronounced to be in
a state of imminent danger. One day James Cowie
called at the house, and inquired, in a flurried manner,
how George Skirving was.</p>

<p>"He is sae ill that I hae very little hope o' him,"
said Mrs. Skirving.</p>

<p>"Good God!" replied the man, "is it possible? I
have murdered him." And he groaned in distress.</p>

<p>"What do ye mean, James?"</p>

<p>"Six o' us wagered, three against three, and twa to
ane," he proceeded, "that our side wadna put your
husband to his bed. We met him in Fife at different
places o' the road, and terrified him, by describing his
looks, into an opinion that he was unwell. I'm come
to make amends. What is the £10 to me when the
life o' a fellow-creature is at jeopardy?"</p>

<p>It was too late. We need say no more. The communication
was made to the sick man; but he was too
far gone to recover, and died in a few days afterwards.
This is a true tale, and requires little more explanation.
It may have been gathered from our narrative, that
Cowie, Willison, and Paterson were the only persons
who were in the plot. John Sharpe, Widow M'Murdo,
Andrew Gemmel, and the others who merely noticed his
dejection, were entirely ignorant of the cruel purpose.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
